Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>¶ And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all <span class='add'>they of</span> Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah <span class='add'>was</span> four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king’s word was abominable to Joab. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> And…: Heb.

Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>; for very great <span class='add'>are</span> his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> very great: or, very many</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>¶ So the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand. And the angel of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Ornan: also called, Araunah</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders <span class='add'>of Israel, who were</span> clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> And David said unto God, <span class='add'>Is it</span> not I <span class='add'>that</span> commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but <span class='add'>as for</span> these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O <span class='nd'>LORD</span> my God, be on me, and on my father’s house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>¶ Then the angel of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and set up an altar unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves.
