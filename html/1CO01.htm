<div class='mt'>THE FIRST EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE CORINTHIANS  
</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span> Paul, called <span class='add'>to be</span> an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes <span class='add'>our</span> brother,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called <span class='add'>to be</span> saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> Grace <span class='add'>be</span> unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and <span class='add'>from</span> the Lord Jesus Christ. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and <span class='add'>in</span> all knowledge;  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> Who shall also confirm you unto the end, <span class='add'>that ye may be</span> blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> God <span class='add'>is</span> faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and <span class='add'>that</span> there be no divisions among you; but <span class='add'>that</span> ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them <span class='add'>which are of the house</span> of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> Where <span class='add'>is</span> the wise? where <span class='add'>is</span> the scribe? where <span class='add'>is</span> the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, <span class='add'>are called</span>:  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, <span class='add'>yea</span>, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> That no flesh should glory in his presence.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
