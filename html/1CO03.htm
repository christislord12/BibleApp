But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> Every man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man’s work of what sort it is.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> If any man’s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and <span class='add'>that</span> the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which <span class='add'>temple</span> ye are. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> And ye are Christ’s; and Christ <span class='add'>is</span> God’s. </div><ul class='tnav'>
