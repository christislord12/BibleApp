Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened <span class='add'>bread</span> of sincerity and truth.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person. </div><ul class='tnav'>
