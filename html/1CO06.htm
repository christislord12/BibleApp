Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather <span class='add'>suffer yourselves to</span> be defrauded?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that <span class='add'>your</span> brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body <span class='add'>is</span> not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make <span class='add'>them</span> the members of an harlot? God forbid.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost <span class='add'>which is</span> in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s. </div><ul class='tnav'>
