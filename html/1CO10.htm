The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> For we <span class='add'>being</span> many are one bread, <span class='add'>and</span> one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> But I <span class='add'>say</span>, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord’s table, and of the table of devils.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> Let no man seek his own, but every man another’s <span class='add'>wealth</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, <span class='add'>that</span> eat, asking no question for conscience sake:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> For the earth <span class='add'>is</span> the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> If any of them that believe not bid you <span class='add'>to a feast</span>, and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth <span class='add'>is</span> the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof:  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another <span class='add'>man’s</span> conscience?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> Even as I please all <span class='add'>men</span> in all <span class='add'>things</span>, not seeking mine own profit, but the <span class='add'>profit</span> of many, that they may be saved. </div><ul class='tnav'>
