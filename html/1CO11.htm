What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise <span class='add'>you</span> not.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the <span class='add'>same</span> night in which he was betrayed took bread:  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> And when he had given thanks, he brake <span class='add'>it</span>, and said, <span class='wj'> Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> After the same manner also <span class='add'>he took</span> the cup, when he had supped, saying, <span class='wj'> This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink <span class='add'>it</span>, in remembrance of me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink <span class='add'>this</span> cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of <span class='add'>that</span> bread, and drink of <span class='add'>that</span> cup.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> For this cause many <span class='add'>are</span> weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come. </div><ul class='tnav'>
