I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that <span class='add'>by my voice</span> I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an <span class='add'>unknown</span> tongue.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> In the law it is written, With <span class='add'>men of</span> other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying <span class='add'>serveth</span> not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in <span class='add'>those that are</span> unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or <span class='add'>one</span> unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on <span class='add'>his</span> face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> If any man speak in an <span class='add'>unknown</span> tongue, <span class='add'>let it be</span> by two, or at the most <span class='add'>by</span> three, and <span class='add'>that</span> by course; and let one interpret.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> If <span class='add'>any thing</span> be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> For God is not <span class='add'>the author</span> of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but <span class='add'>they are commanded</span> to be under obedience, as also saith the law.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span> What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span> If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span> But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span> Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span> Let all things be done decently and in order. </div><ul class='tnav'>
