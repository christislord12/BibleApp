But when he saith all things are put under <span class='add'>him, it is</span> manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak <span class='add'>this</span> to your shame. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> But some <span class='add'>man</span> will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span> <span class='add'>Thou</span> fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span> And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other <span class='add'>grain</span>:  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span> But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span> All flesh <span class='add'>is</span> not the same flesh: but <span class='add'>there is</span> one <span class='add'>kind of</span> flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, <span class='add'>and</span> another of birds.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span> <span class='add'>There are</span> also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial <span class='add'>is</span> one, and the <span class='add'>glory</span> of the terrestrial <span class='add'>is</span> another.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span> <span class='add'>There is</span> one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for <span class='add'>one</span> star differeth from <span class='add'>another</span> star in glory.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span> So also <span class='add'>is</span> the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span> It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span> It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span> And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam <span class='add'>was made</span> a quickening spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span> Howbeit that <span class='add'>was</span> not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span> The first man <span class='add'>is</span> of the earth, earthy: the second man <span class='add'>is</span> the Lord from heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span> As <span class='add'>is</span> the earthy, such <span class='add'>are</span> they also that are earthy: and as <span class='add'>is</span> the heavenly, such <span class='add'>are</span> they also that are heavenly.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span> And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span> Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span> Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span> In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span> For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal <span class='add'>must</span> put on immortality.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span> So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span> O death, where <span class='add'>is</span> thy sting? O grave, where <span class='add'>is</span> thy victory?  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span> The sting of death <span class='add'>is</span> sin; and the strength of sin <span class='add'>is</span> the law.  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span> But thanks <span class='add'>be</span> to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span> Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
