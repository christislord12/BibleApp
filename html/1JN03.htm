For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> Not as Cain, <span class='add'>who</span> was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother’s righteous. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not <span class='add'>his</span> brother abideth in death.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> Hereby perceive we the love <span class='add'> of God</span>, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down <span class='add'>our</span> lives for the brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> But whoso hath this world’s good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels <span class='add'>of compassion</span> from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, <span class='add'>then</span> have we confidence toward God.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us. </div><ul class='tnav'>
