Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son <span class='add'>to be</span> the propitiation for our sins.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son <span class='add'>to be</span> the Saviour of the world.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> We love him, because he first loved us.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also. </div><ul class='tnav'>
