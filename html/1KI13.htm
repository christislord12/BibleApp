And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now the face of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again.

For his sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> And he said unto his sons, Saddle  me the ass. So they saddled him the ass: and he rode thereon,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said unto him, <span class='add'>Art</span> thou the man of God that camest from Judah?
