And they said, Go up; for the Lord shall deliver <span class='add'>it</span> into the hand of the king.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> And Jehoshaphat said, <span class='add'>Is there</span> not here a prophet of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> besides, that we might enquire of him?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, <span class='add'>There is</span> yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten <span class='add'>hither</span> Micaiah the son of Imlah.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> officer: or, eunuch</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> void…: Heb. floor</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou have consumed them.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> And all the prophets prophesied  so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper: for the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> shall deliver <span class='add'>it</span> into the king’s hand.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets <span class='add'>declare</span> good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak <span class='add'>that which is</span> good.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And Micaiah said, <span class='add'>As</span> the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> liveth, what the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> saith unto me, that will I speak. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>¶ So he came to the king.
