Yea, all <span class='add'>of you</span> be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle <span class='add'>you</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> To him <span class='add'>be</span> glory and dominion for ever and ever.
