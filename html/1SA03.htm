And the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> was precious in those days; <span class='add'>there was</span> no open vision.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> And it came to pass at that time, when Eli <span class='add'>was</span> laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, <span class='add'>that</span> he could not see;  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, where the ark of God <span class='add'>was</span>, and Samuel was laid down <span class='add'>to sleep;</span>  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> That the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> called Samuel: and he answered, Here <span class='add'>am</span> I.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here <span class='add'>am</span> I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here <span class='add'>am</span> I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> Now Samuel did not yet know the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, neither was the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> yet revealed unto him.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Now…: or, Thus did Samuel before he knew the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and before the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> was revealed unto him</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> called Samuel again the third time.

And Eli perceived that the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> had called the child.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, <span class='nd'>LORD</span>; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>¶ And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> In that day I will perform against Eli all <span class='add'>things</span> which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> when…: Heb. beginning and ending</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> For I…: or, And I will tell him</span></a><a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> vile: or, accursed</span></a><a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> restrained…: Heb. frowned not upon them</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>¶ And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.
