Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> fetch: Heb. take unto us</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts, which dwelleth <span class='add'>between</span> the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, <span class='add'>were</span> there with the ark of the covenant of God.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> And when the ark of the covenant of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What <span class='add'>meaneth</span> the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> was come into the camp.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp.

And when the man came into the city, and told <span class='add'>it</span>, all the city cried out.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What <span class='add'>meaneth</span> the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see.<a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§§<span class="popup"> were dim: Heb. stood</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> And the man said unto Eli, I <span class='add'>am</span> he that came out of the army, and I fled to day out of the army.
