But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>¶ And Samuel called the people together unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> to Mizpeh;  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, <span class='add'>and</span> of them that oppressed you:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> And ye have this day rejected  your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have said unto him, <span class='add'>Nay</span>, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> by your tribes, and by your thousands.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> Therefore they enquired of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> further, if the man should yet come thither. And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the stuff.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath chosen, that <span class='add'>there is</span> none like him among all the people?
