So none of the people tasted <span class='add'>any</span> food.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And all <span class='add'>they of</span> the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that <span class='add'>was</span> in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed <span class='add'>be</span> the man that eateth <span class='add'>any</span> food this day.
