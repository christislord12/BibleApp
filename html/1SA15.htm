So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah <span class='add'>until</span> thou comest to Shur, that <span class='add'>is</span> over against Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all <span class='add'>that was</span> good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing <span class='add'>that was</span> vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> fatlings: or, second sort</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>¶ Then came the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> unto Samuel, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> It repenteth me that I have set up Saul <span class='add'>to be</span> king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> all night.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed <span class='add'>be</span> thou of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>: I have performed the commandment of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And Samuel said, What <span class='add'>meaneth</span> then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> And Samuel said, When thou <span class='add'>wast</span> little in thine own sight, <span class='add'>wast</span> thou not <span class='add'>made</span> the head of the tribes of Israel, and the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> anointed thee king over Israel?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> they…: Heb. they consume them</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and have gone the way which the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> thy God in Gilgal.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> And Samuel said, Hath the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> <span class='add'>as great</span> delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>? Behold, to obey <span class='add'>is</span> better than sacrifice, <span class='add'>and</span> to hearken than the fat of rams.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> For rebellion <span class='add'>is as</span> the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness <span class='add'>is as</span> iniquity and idolatry.
