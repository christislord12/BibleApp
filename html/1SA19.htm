And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> in times…: Heb. yesterday, third day</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>¶ And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> him: Heb. his face</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> And the evil spirit from the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with <span class='add'>his</span> hand.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin; but he slipped away out of Saul’s presence, and he smote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> Saul also sent messengers unto David’s house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David’s wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>¶ So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> And Michal took an image, and laid <span class='add'>it</span> in the bed, and put a pillow of goats’ <span class='add'>hair</span> for his bolster, and covered <span class='add'>it</span> with a cloth.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> image: Heb. teraphim</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He <span class='add'>is</span> sick.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> And Saul sent the messengers <span class='add'>again</span> to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> And when the messengers were come in, behold, <span class='add'>there was</span> an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats’ <span class='add'>hair</span> for his bolster.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped?

And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David <span class='add'>is</span> at Naioth in Ramah.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing <span class='add'>as</span> appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that <span class='add'>is</span> in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where <span class='add'>are</span> Samuel and David? And <span class='add'>one</span> said, Behold, <span class='add'>they be</span> at Naioth in Ramah.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night.
