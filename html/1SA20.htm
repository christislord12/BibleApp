And Jonathan’s lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span> But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span> And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry <span class='add'>them</span> to the city.<a href="#FN18" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> artillery: Heb. instruments</span></a><a href="#FN19" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> his lad: Heb. the lad that was his</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>¶ <span class='add'>And</span> as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of <span class='add'>a place</span> toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span> And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, saying, The <span class='nd'>LORD</span> be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever.
