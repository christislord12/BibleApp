And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> And David’s men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> Then David enquired of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> yet again. And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, <span class='add'>that</span> he came down <span class='add'>with</span> an ephod in his hand. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>¶ And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>¶ And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> Then said David, O <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said, He will come down.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said, They will deliver <span class='add'>thee</span> up.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> deliver: Heb. shut up</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>¶ Then David and his men, <span class='add'>which were</span> about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David <span class='add'>was</span> in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>¶ And Jonathan Saul’s son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> And they two made a covenant before the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>¶ Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which <span class='add'>is</span> on the south of Jeshimon?<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> on…: Heb. on the right hand</span></a><a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Jeshimon: or, the wilderness</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part <span class='add'>shall be</span> to deliver him into the king’s hand.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> And Saul said, Blessed <span class='add'>be</span> ye of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>; for ye have compassion on me.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is, <span class='add'>and</span> who hath seen him there: for it is told me <span class='add'>that</span> he dealeth very subtilly.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> haunt…: Heb. foot shall be</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men <span class='add'>were</span> in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> Saul also and his men went to seek <span class='add'>him</span>.
