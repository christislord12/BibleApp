<div class='mt'>THE FIRST EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE TO TIMOTHY  
</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, <span class='add'>which is</span> our hope;  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> Unto Timothy, <span class='add'>my</span> own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, <span class='add'>and</span> peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: <span class='add'>so do</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and <span class='add'>of</span> a good conscience, and <span class='add'>of</span> faith unfeigned:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> But we know that the law <span class='add'>is</span> good, if a man use it lawfully;  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did <span class='add'>it</span> ignorantly in unbelief.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> This <span class='add'>is</span> a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, <span class='add'>be</span> honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme. </div><ul class='tnav'>
