And, The labourer <span class='add'>is</span> worthy of his reward.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> I charge <span class='add'>thee</span> before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins: keep thyself pure.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake and thine often infirmities.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> Some men’s sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some <span class='add'>men</span> they follow after.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> Likewise also the good works <span class='add'>of some</span> are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot  be hid. </div><ul class='tnav'>
