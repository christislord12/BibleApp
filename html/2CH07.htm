and the glory of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> filled the house.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> And the priests could not enter into the house of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, because the glory of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> had filled the <span class='nd'>LORD’s</span> house.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and praised the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, <span class='add'>saying</span>, For <span class='add'>he is</span> good; for his mercy <span class='add'>endureth</span> for ever. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>¶ Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with instruments of musick of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, which David the king had made to praise the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, because his mercy <span class='add'>endureth</span> for ever, when David praised by their ministry;
