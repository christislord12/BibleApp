In his days the land was quiet ten years.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> And Asa did <span class='add'>that which was</span> good and right in the eyes of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> his God:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> For he took away the altars of the strange <span class='add'>gods</span>, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> images: Heb. statues</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> And commanded Judah to seek the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> images: Heb. sun images</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>¶ And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> had given him rest.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about <span class='add'>them</span> walls, and towers, gates, and bars, <span class='add'>while</span> the land <span class='add'>is</span> yet before us; because we have sought the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> our God, we have sought <span class='add'>him</span>, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And Asa had an army <span class='add'>of men</span> that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these <span class='add'>were</span> mighty men of valour. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>¶ And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> And Asa cried unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> his God, and said, <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, <span class='add'>it is</span> nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O <span class='nd'>LORD</span> our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude.
