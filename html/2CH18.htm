And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that <span class='add'>he had</span> with him, and persuaded him to go up <span class='add'>with him</span> to Ramoth-gilead.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> after…: Heb. at the end of years</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth-gilead? And he answered him, I <span class='add'>am</span> as thou <span class='add'>art</span>, and my people as thy people; and <span class='add'>we will be</span> with thee in the war. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>¶ And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> to day.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver <span class='add'>it</span> into the king’s hand.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> But Jehoshaphat said, <span class='add'>Is there</span> not here a prophet of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> besides, that we might enquire of him?<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> besides: Heb. yet, or, more</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, <span class='add'>There is</span> yet one man, by whom we may enquire of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same <span class='add'>is</span> Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And the king of Israel called for one <span class='add'>of his</span> officers, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> officers: or, eunuchs</span></a><a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Fetch…: Heb.

And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said, These have no master; let them return <span class='add'>therefore</span> every man to his house in peace.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee <span class='add'>that</span> he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?<a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§§<span class="popup"> but evil: or, but for evil</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>; I saw the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> sitting  upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and <span class='add'>on</span> his left.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and said, I will entice him. And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said unto him, Wherewith?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And <span class='add'>the <span class='nd'>Lord</span></span> said, Thou shalt entice <span class='add'>him</span>, and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do <span class='add'>even</span> so.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> Now therefore, behold, the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath spoken evil against thee.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> from me to speak unto thee?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.<a href="#FN9" class="notemark">***<span class="popup"> into…: or, from chamber to chamber: Heb. a chamber in a chamber</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son;  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> And say, Thus saith the king, Put this <span class='add'>fellow</span> in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, <span class='add'>then</span> hath not the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye people. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that <span class='add'>were</span> with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save only with the king of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It <span class='add'>is</span> the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> helped him; and God moved them <span class='add'>to depart</span> from him.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him.<a href="#FN10" class="notemark">†††<span class="popup"> from…: Heb. from after him</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And a <span class='add'>certain</span> man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.<a href="#FN11" class="notemark">‡‡‡<span class="popup"> at a venture: Heb. in his simplicity</span></a><a href="#FN12" class="notemark">§§§<span class="popup"> between…: Heb. between the joints and between the breastplate</span></a><a href="#FN13" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> wounded: Heb. made sick</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed <span class='add'>himself</span> up in <span class='add'>his</span> chariot against the Syrians until the even: and about the time of the sun going down he died. </div><ul class='tnav'>
