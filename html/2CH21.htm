And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these <span class='add'>were</span> the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because he <span class='add'>was</span> the firstborn.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the sword, and <span class='add'>divers</span> also of the princes of Israel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>¶ Jehoram <span class='add'>was</span> thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he wrought <span class='add'>that which was</span> evil in the eyes of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> Howbeit the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> light: Heb. lamp, or, candle</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>¶ In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah, and made themselves a king.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> dominion: Heb. hand</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him in, and the captains of the chariots.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. The same time <span class='add'>also</span> did Libnah revolt from under his hand; because he had forsaken the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God of his fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and compelled Judah <span class='add'>thereto</span>. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>¶ And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God of David thy father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father’s house, <span class='add'>which were</span> better than thyself:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> Behold, with a great plague will the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> smite thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy goods:<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> a great…: Heb. a great stroke</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And thou <span class='add'>shalt have</span> great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>¶ Moreover the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that <span class='add'>were</span> near the Ethiopians:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> And they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king’s house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> carried…: Heb. carried captive</span></a><a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Jehoahaz: also called, Ahaziah, or, Azariah</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>¶ And after all this the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore diseases.
