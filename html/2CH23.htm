And he said unto them, Behold, the king’s son shall reign, as the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath said of the sons of David.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>This <span class='add'>is</span> the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you entering on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, <span class='add'>shall be</span> porters of the doors;<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> doors: Heb. thresholds</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> And a third part <span class='add'>shall be</span> at the king’s house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people <span class='add'>shall be</span> in the courts of the house of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> But let none come into the house of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall go in, for they <span class='add'>are</span> holy: but all the people shall keep the watch of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever <span class='add'>else</span> cometh into the house, he shall be put to death: but be ye with the king when he cometh in, and when he goeth out.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go <span class='add'>out</span> on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that <span class='add'>had been</span> king David’s, which <span class='add'>were</span> in the house of God.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king round about.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> side: Heb. shoulder</span></a><a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> temple: Heb. house</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> Then they brought out the king’s son, and put upon him the crown, and <span class='add'>gave him</span> the testimony, and made him king.

Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Treason: Heb.
