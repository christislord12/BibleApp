Howbeit the Levites hastened <span class='add'>it</span> not.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, <span class='add'>according to the commandment</span> of Moses the servant of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> did they bestow upon Baalim.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And at the king’s commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> the collection <span class='add'>that</span> Moses the servant of God <span class='add'>laid</span> upon Israel in the wilderness.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> a proclamation: Heb. a voice</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king’s office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that <span class='add'>there was</span> much money, the king’s scribe and the high priest’s officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> the work…: Heb. the healing went up upon the work</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And when they had finished <span class='add'>it</span>, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, <span class='add'>even</span> vessels to minister, and to offer <span class='add'>withal</span>, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver.

Then the king hearkened unto them.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> And they left the house of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God of their fathers, and served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, he hath also forsaken you.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> came…: Heb. clothed</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son.
