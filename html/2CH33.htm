Then Manasseh knew that the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> he <span class='add'>was</span> God.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Ophel: or, the tower</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and in Jerusalem, and cast <span class='add'>them</span> out of the city.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> And he repaired the altar of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, <span class='add'>yet</span> unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> their God only. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>¶ Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God of Israel, behold, they <span class='add'>are written</span> in the book of the kings of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> His prayer also, and <span class='add'>how God</span> was intreated of him, and all his sin, and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they <span class='add'>are</span> written among the sayings of the seers.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> the seers: or, Hosai</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>¶ So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>¶ Amon <span class='add'>was</span> two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned two years in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> But he did <span class='add'>that which was</span> evil in the sight of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, as did Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed  unto all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them;  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> And humbled not himself before the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> trespassed more and more: Heb. multiplied trespass</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own house. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>¶ But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead. </div><ul class='tnav'>
