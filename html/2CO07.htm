In all <span class='add'>things</span> ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, <span class='add'>I did it</span> not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which <span class='add'>I made</span> before Titus, is found a truth.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all <span class='add'>things.</span> </div><ul class='tnav'>
