<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 10</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span> Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence <span class='add'>am</span> base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> But I beseech <span class='add'>you</span>, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>(For the weapons of our warfare <span class='add'>are</span> not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ’s, let him of himself think this again, that, as he <span class='add'>is</span> Christ’s, even so <span class='add'>are</span> we Christ’s.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> For <span class='add'>his</span> letters, say they, <span class='add'>are</span> weighty and powerful; but <span class='add'>his</span> bodily presence <span class='add'>is</span> weak, and <span class='add'>his</span> speech contemptible.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such <span class='add'>will we be</span> also in deed when we are present.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> But we will not boast of things without <span class='add'>our</span> measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> For we stretch not ourselves beyond <span class='add'>our measure</span>, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in <span class='add'>preaching</span> the gospel of Christ:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> Not boasting of things without <span class='add'>our</span> measure, <span class='add'>that is</span>, of other men’s labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> To preach the gospel in the <span class='add'>regions</span> beyond you, <span class='add'>and</span> not to boast in another man’s line of things made ready to our hand.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth. </div><ul class='tnav'>
