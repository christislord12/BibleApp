but they have provoked me unto wrath, and despised my counsels. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Pull thou off then the hair of thy head, and cast all evil upon them, for they have not been obedient unto my law, but it is a rebellious people. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>How long shall I forbear them, unto whom I have done so much good?

when ye were hungry and thirsty in the wilderness, did ye not cry unto me, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Saying, Why hast thou brought us into this wilderness to kill us? it had been better for us to have served the Egyptians, than to die in this wilderness. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then had I pity upon your mournings, and gave you manna to eat; so ye did eat angels’ bread. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>When ye were thirsty, did I not cleave the rock, and waters flowed out to your fill? for the heat I covered you with the leaves of the trees. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>I divided among you a fruitful land, I cast out the Canaanites, the Pherezites, and the Philistines, before you: what shall I yet do more for you?
