I am a widow and forsaken: go your way, O my children, and ask mercy of the Lord. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>As for me, O father, I call upon thee for a witness over the mother of these children, which would not keep my covenant, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>That thou bring them to confusion, and their mother to a spoil, that there may be no offspring of them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Let them be scattered abroad among the heathen, let their names be put out of the earth: for they have despised my covenant. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Woe be unto thee, Assur, thou that hidest the unrighteous in thee! O thou wicked people, remember what I did unto Sodom and Gomorrha; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Whose land lieth in clods of pitch and heaps of ashes: even so also will I do unto them that hear me not, saith the Almighty Lord. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord unto Esdras, Tell my people that I will give them the kingdom of Jerusalem, which I would have given unto Israel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Their glory also will I take unto me, and give these the everlasting tabernacles, which I had prepared for them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>They shall have the tree of life for an ointment of sweet savour;
