<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 3</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>In the thirtieth year after the ruin of the city I was in Babylon, and lay troubled upon my bed, and my thoughts came up over my heart: </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>For I saw the desolation of Sion, and the wealth of them that dwelt at Babylon. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And my spirit was sore moved, so that I began to speak words full of fear to the most High, and said, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>O Lord, who bearest rule, thou spakest at the beginning, when thou didst plant the earth, and that thyself alone, and commandedst the people, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And gavest a body unto Adam without soul, which was the workmanship of thine hands, and didst breathe into him the breath of life, and he was made living before thee. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And thou leadest him into paradise, which thy right hand had planted, before ever the earth came forward. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And unto him thou gavest commandment to love thy way: which he transgressed, and immediately thou appointedst death in him and in his generations, of whom came nations, tribes, people, and kindreds, out of number. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And every people walked after their own will, and did wonderful things before thee, and despised thy commandments. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And again in process of time thou broughtest the flood upon those that dwelt in the world, and destroyedst them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And it came to pass in every of them, that as death was to Adam, so was the flood to these. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Nevertheless one of them thou leftest, namely, Noah with his household, of whom came all righteous men. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And it happened, that when they that dwelt upon the earth began to multiply, and had gotten them many children, and were a great people, they began again to be more ungodly than the first. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Now when they lived so wickedly before thee, thou didst choose thee a man from among them, whose name was Abraham. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Him thou lovedst, and unto him only thou shewedst thy will: </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And madest an everlasting covenant with him, promising him that thou wouldest never forsake his seed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And unto him thou gavest Isaac, and unto Isaac also thou gavest Jacob and Esau. As for Jacob, thou didst choose him to thee, and put by Esau: and so Jacob became a great multitude. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And it came to pass, that when thou leadest his seed out of Egypt, thou broughtest them up to the mount Sinai. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And bowing the heavens, thou didst set fast the earth, movedst the whole world, and madest the depths to tremble, and troubledst the men of that age. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And thy glory went through four gates, of fire, and of earthquake, and of wind, and of cold; that thou mightest give the law unto the seed of Jacob, and diligence unto the generation of Israel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And yet tookest thou not away from them a wicked heart, that thy law might bring forth fruit in them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For the first Adam bearing a wicked heart transgressed, and was overcome; and so be all they that are born of him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Thus infirmity was made permanent; and the law (also) in the heart of the people with the malignity of the root; so that the good departed away, and the evil abode still. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>So the times passed away, and the years were brought to an end: then didst thou raise thee up a servant, called David: </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Whom thou commandedst to build a city unto thy name, and to offer incense and oblations unto thee therein. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>When this was done many years, then they that inhabited the city forsook thee, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And in all things did even as Adam and all his generations had done: for they also had a wicked heart: </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And so thou gavest thy city over into the hands of thine enemies. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Are their deeds then any better that inhabit Babylon, that they should therefore have the dominion over Sion? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For when I came thither, and had seen impieties without number, then my soul saw many evildoers in this thirtieth year, so that my heart failed me. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For I have seen how thou sufferest them sinning, and hast spared wicked doers: and hast destroyed thy people, and hast preserved thine enemies, and hast not signified it. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>I do not remember how this way may be left: Are they then of Babylon better than they of Sion? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Or is there any other people that knoweth thee beside Israel? or what generation hath so believed thy covenants as Jacob? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And yet their reward appeareth not, and their labour hath no fruit: for I have gone here and there through the heathen, and I see that they flow in wealth, and think not upon thy commandments. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Weigh thou therefore our wickedness now in the balance, and theirs also that dwell the world; and so shall thy name no where be found but in Israel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Or when was it that they which dwell upon the earth have not sinned in thy sight? or what people have so kept thy commandments? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Thou shalt find that Israel by name hath kept thy precepts; but not the heathen. </div><ul class='tnav'>
