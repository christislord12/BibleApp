<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 6</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And he said unto me, In the beginning, when the earth was made, before the borders of the world stood, or ever the winds blew, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Before it thundered and lightened, or ever the foundations of paradise were laid, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Before the fair flowers were seen, or ever the moveable powers were established, before the innumerable multitude of angels were gathered together, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Or ever the heights of the air were lifted up, before the measures of the firmament were named, or ever the chimneys in Sion were hot, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And ere the present years were sought out, and or ever the inventions of them that now sin were turned, before they were sealed that have gathered faith for a treasure: </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then did I consider these things, and they all were made through me alone, and through none other: by me also they shall be ended, and by none other. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then answered I and said, What shall be the parting asunder of the times? or when shall be the end of the first, and the beginning of it that followeth? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And he said unto me, From Abraham unto Isaac, when Jacob and Esau were born of him, Jacob’s hand held first the heel of Esau. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For Esau is the end of the world, and Jacob is the beginning of it that followeth. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The hand of man is betwixt the heel and the hand: other question, Esdras, ask thou not. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I answered then and said, O Lord that bearest rule, if I have found favour in thy sight, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I beseech thee, shew thy servant the end of thy tokens, whereof thou shewedst me part the last night. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So he answered and said unto me, Stand up upon thy feet, and hear a mighty sounding voice. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And it shall be as it were a great motion; but the place where thou standest shall not be moved. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And therefore when it speaketh be not afraid: for the word is of the end, and the foundation of the earth is understood. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And why? because the speech of these things trembleth and is moved: for it knoweth that the end of these things must be changed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And it happened, that when I had heard it I stood up upon my feet, and hearkened, and, behold, there was a voice that spake, and the sound of it was like the sound of many waters. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And it said, Behold, the days come, that I will begin to draw nigh, and to visit them that dwell upon the earth, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And will begin to make inquisition of them, what they be that have hurt unjustly with their unrighteousness, and when the affliction of Sion shall be fulfilled; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And when the world, that shall begin to vanish away, shall be finished, then will I shew these tokens: the books shall be opened before the firmament, and they shall see all together: </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the children of a year old shall speak with their voices, the women with child shall bring forth untimely children of three or four months old, and they shall live, and be raised up. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And suddenly shall the sown places appear unsown, the full storehouses shall suddenly be found empty: </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the trumpet shall give a sound, which when every man heareth, they shall be suddenly afraid. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>At that time shall friends fight one against another like enemies, and the earth shall stand in fear with those that dwell therein, the springs of the fountains shall stand still, and in three hours they shall not run. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Whosoever remaineth from all these that I have told thee shall escape, and see my salvation, and the end of your world. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the men that are received shall see it, who have not tasted death from their birth: and the heart of the inhabitants shall be changed, and turned into another meaning. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For evil shall be put out, and deceit shall be quenched. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>As for faith, it shall flourish, corruption shall be overcome, and the truth, which hath been so long without fruit, shall be declared. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And when he talked with me, behold, I looked by little and little upon him before whom I stood. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And these words said he unto me; I am come to shew thee the time of the night to come. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>If thou wilt pray yet more, and fast seven days again, I shall tell thee greater things by day than I have heard. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>For thy voice is heard before the most High: for the Mighty hath seen thy righteous dealing, he hath seen also thy chastity, which thou hast had ever since thy youth. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And therefore hath he sent me to shew thee all these things, and to say unto thee, Be of good comfort and fear not </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And hasten not with the times that are past, to think vain things, that thou mayest not hasten from the latter times. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And it came to pass after this, that I wept again, and fasted seven days in like manner, that I might fulfil the three weeks which he told me. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And in the eighth night was my heart vexed within me again, and I began to speak before the most High. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>For my spirit was greatly set on fire, and my soul was in distress. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And I said, O Lord, thou spakest from the beginning of the creation, even the first day, and saidst thus; Let heaven and earth be made; and thy word was a perfect work. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And then was the spirit, and darkness and silence were on every side; the sound of man’s voice was not yet formed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Then commandedst thou a fair light to come forth of thy treasures, that thy work might appear. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Upon the second day thou madest the spirit of the firmament, and commandedst it to part asunder, and to make a division betwixt the waters, that the one part might go up, and the other remain beneath. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Upon the third day thou didst command that the waters should be gathered in the seventh part of the earth: six parts hast thou dried up, and kept them, to the intent that of these some being planted of God and tilled might serve thee. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>For as soon as thy word went forth the work was made. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>For immediately there was great and innumerable fruit, and many and divers pleasures for the taste, and flowers of unchangeable colour, and odours of wonderful smell: and this was done the third day. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Upon the fourth day thou commandedst that the sun should shine, and the moon give her light, and the stars should be in order: </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And gavest them a charge to do service unto man, that was to be made. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Upon the fifth day thou saidst unto the seventh part, where the waters were gathered that it should bring forth living creatures, fowls and fishes: and so it came to pass. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>For the dumb water and without life brought forth living things at the commandment of God, that all people might praise thy wondrous works. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Then didst thou ordain two living creatures, the one thou calledst Enoch, and the other Leviathan; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>And didst separate the one from the other: for the seventh part, namely, where the water was gathered together, might not hold them both. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Unto Enoch thou gavest one part, which was dried up the third day, that he should dwell in the same part, wherein are a thousand hills: </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>But unto Leviathan thou gavest the seventh part, namely, the moist; and hast kept him to be devoured of whom thou wilt, and when. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>Upon the sixth day thou gavest commandment unto the earth, that before thee it should bring forth beasts, cattle, and creeping things: </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>And after these, Adam also, whom thou madest lord of all thy creatures: of him come we all, and the people also whom thou hast chosen. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>All this have I spoken before thee, O Lord, because thou madest the world for our sakes. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>As for the other people, which also come of Adam, thou hast said that they are nothing, but be like unto spittle: and hast likened the abundance of them unto a drop that falleth from a vessel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>And now, O Lord, behold, these heathen, which have ever been reputed as nothing, have begun to be lords over us, and to devour us. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>But we thy people, whom thou hast called thy firstborn, thy only begotten, and thy fervent lover, are given into their hands. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>If the world now be made for our sakes, why do we not possess an inheritance with the world? how long shall this endure? </div><ul class='tnav'>
