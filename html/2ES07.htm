<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 7</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And when I had made an end of speaking these words, there was sent unto me the angel which had been sent unto me the nights afore: </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And he said unto me, Up, Esdras, and hear the words that I am come to tell thee. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And I said, Speak on, my God. Then said he unto me, The sea is set in a wide place, that it might be deep and great. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But put the case the entrance were narrow, and like a river; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Who then could go into the sea to look upon it, and to rule it? if he went not through the narrow, how could he come into the broad? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>There is also another thing; A city is builded, and set upon a broad field, and is full of all good things: </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The entrance thereof is narrow, and is set in a dangerous place to fall, like as if there were a fire on the right hand, and on the left a deep water: </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And one only path between them both, even between the fire and the water, so small that there could but one man go there at once. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>If this city now were given unto a man for an inheritance, if he never shall pass the danger set before it, how shall he receive this inheritance? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And I said, It is so, Lord. Then said he unto me, Even so also is Israel’s portion. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Because for their sakes I made the world: and when Adam transgressed my statutes, then was decreed that now is done. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then were the entrances of this world made narrow, full of sorrow and travail: they are but few and evil, full of perils, and very painful. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For the entrances of the elder world were wide and sure, and brought immortal fruit. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>If then they that live labour not to enter these strait and vain things, they can never receive those that are laid up for them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Now therefore why disquietest thou thyself, seeing thou art but a corruptible man? and why art thou moved, whereas thou art but mortal? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Why hast thou not considered in thy mind this thing that is to come, rather than that which is present? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then answered I and said, O Lord that bearest rule, thou hast ordained in thy law, that the righteous should inherit these things, but that the ungodly should perish. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Nevertheless the righteous shall suffer strait things, and hope for wide: for they that have done wickedly have suffered the strait things, and yet shall not see the wide. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he said unto me. There is no judge above God, and none that hath understanding above the Highest. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For there be many that perish in this life, because they despise the law of God that is set before them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For God hath given strait commandment to such as came, what they should do to live, even as they came, and what they should observe to avoid punishment. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Nevertheless they were not obedient unto him; but spake against him, and imagined vain things; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And deceived themselves by their wicked deeds; and said of the most High, that he is not; and knew not his ways: </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But his law have they despised, and denied his covenants; in his statutes have they not been faithful, and have not performed his works. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And therefore, Esdras, for the empty are empty things, and for the full are the full things. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Behold, the time shall come, that these tokens which I have told thee shall come to pass, and the bride shall appear, and she coming forth shall be seen, that now is withdrawn from the earth. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And whosoever is delivered from the foresaid evils shall see my wonders. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For my son Jesus shall be revealed with those that be with him, and they that remain shall rejoice within four hundred years. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>After these years shall my son Christ die, and all men that have life. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And the world shall be turned into the old silence seven days, like as in the former judgments: so that no man shall remain. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And after seven days the world, that yet awaketh not, shall be raised up, and that shall die that is corrupt. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the earth shall restore those that are asleep in her, and so shall the dust those that dwell in silence, and the secret places shall deliver those souls that were committed unto them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And the most High shall appear upon the seat of judgment, and misery shall pass away, and the long suffering shall have an end: </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But judgment only shall remain, truth shall stand, and faith shall wax strong: </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And the work shall follow, and the reward shall be shewed, and the good deeds shall be of force, and wicked deeds shall bear no rule. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Then said I, Abraham prayed first for the Sodomites, and Moses for the fathers that sinned in the wilderness: </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And Jesus after him for Israel in the time of Achan: </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And Samuel and David for the destruction: and Solomon for them that should come to the sanctuary: </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And Helias for those that received rain; and for the dead, that he might live: </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And Ezechias for the people in the time of Sennacherib: and many for many. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Even so now, seeing corruption is grown up, and wickedness increased, and the righteous have prayed for the ungodly: wherefore shall it not be so now also? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>He answered me, and said, This present life is not the end where much glory doth abide; therefore have they prayed for the weak. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>But the day of doom shall be the end of this time, and the beginning of the immortality for to come, wherein corruption is past, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Intemperance is at an end, infidelity is cut off, righteousness is grown, and truth is sprung up. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Then shall no man be able to save him that is destroyed, nor to oppress him that hath gotten the victory. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>I answered then and said, This is my first and last saying, that it had been better not to have given the earth unto Adam: or else, when it was given him, to have restrained him from sinning. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>For what profit is it for men now in this present time to live in heaviness, and after death to look for punishment? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>O thou Adam, what hast thou done? for though it was thou that sinned, thou art not fallen alone, but we all that come of thee. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>For what profit is it unto us, if there be promised us an immortal time, whereas we have done the works that bring death? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>And that there is promised us an everlasting hope, whereas ourselves being most wicked are made vain? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>And that there are laid up for us dwellings of health and safety, whereas we have lived wickedly? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>And that the glory of the most High is kept to defend them which have led a wary life, whereas we have walked in the most wicked ways of all? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>And that there should be shewed a paradise, whose fruit endureth for ever, wherein is security and medicine, since we shall not enter into it? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>(For we have walked in unpleasant places.) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>And that the faces of them which have used abstinence shall shine above the stars, whereas our faces shall be blacker than darkness? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>For while we lived and committed iniquity, we considered not that we should begin to suffer for it after death. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>Then answered he me, and said, This is the condition of the battle, which man that is born upon the earth shall fight; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>That, if he be overcome, he shall suffer as thou hast said: but if he get the victory, he shall receive the thing that I say. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>For this is the life whereof Moses spake unto the people while he lived, saying, Choose thee life, that thou mayest live. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>Nevertheless they believed not him, nor yet the prophets after him, no nor me which have spoken unto them, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>That there should not be such heaviness in their destruction, as shall be joy over them that are persuaded to salvation. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>I answered then, and said, I know, Lord, that the most High is called merciful, in that he hath mercy upon them which are not yet come into the world, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>And upon those also that turn to his law; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#160;</span>And that he is patient, and long suffereth those that have sinned, as his creatures; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V65">65&#160;</span>And that he is bountiful, for he is ready to give where it needeth; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V66">66&#160;</span>And that he is of great mercy, for he multiplieth more and more mercies to them that are present, and that are past, and also to them which are to come. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V67">67&#160;</span>For if he shall not multiply his mercies, the world would not continue with them that inherit therein. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V68">68&#160;</span>And he pardoneth; for if he did not so of his goodness, that they which have committed iniquities might be eased of them, the ten thousandth part of men should not remain living. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V69">69&#160;</span>And being judge, if he should not forgive them that are cured with his word, and put out the multitude of contentions, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V70">70&#160;</span>There should be very few left peradventure in an innumerable multitude. </div><ul class='tnav'>
