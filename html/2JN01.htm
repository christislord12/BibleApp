This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into <span class='add'>your</span> house, neither bid him God speed:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> Having many things to write unto you, I would not <span class='add'>write</span> with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> The children of thy elect sister greet thee.
