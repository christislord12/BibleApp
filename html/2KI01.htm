And Elijah departed.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Thou shalt…: Heb.

What was the manner of the man</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And they answered him, <span class='add'>He was</span> an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins.

And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I <span class='add'>be</span> a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I <span class='add'>be</span> a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>¶ And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> fell: Heb. bowed</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> And the angel of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> And he said unto him, Thus saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, <span class='add'>is it</span> not because <span class='add'>there is</span> no God in Israel to enquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>¶ So he died according to the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> which Elijah had spoken.
