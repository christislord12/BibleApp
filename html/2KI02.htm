And Elisha said <span class='add'>unto him, As</span> the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> liveth, and <span class='add'>as</span> thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Beth-el.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> And the sons of the prophets that <span class='add'>were</span> at Beth-el came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know <span class='add'>it;</span> hold ye your peace.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, <span class='add'>As</span> the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> liveth, and <span class='add'>as</span> thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> And the sons of the prophets that <span class='add'>were</span> at Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know <span class='add'>it;</span> hold ye your peace.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, <span class='add'>As</span> the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> liveth, and <span class='add'>as</span> thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> to view: Heb. in sight, or, over against</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped <span class='add'>it</span> together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>¶ And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: <span class='add'>nevertheless</span>, if thou see me <span class='add'>when I am</span> taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be <span class='add'>so</span>.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Thou hast…: Heb.

And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>¶ And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> strong…: Heb. sons of strength</span></a><a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> some mountain: Heb. one of the mountains</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send.
