And he said, Behold, thou shalt see <span class='add'>it</span> with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> a lord…: Heb. a lord which belonged to the king leaning upon his hand</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>¶ And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine <span class='add'>is</span> in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold, <span class='add'>there was</span> no man there.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, <span class='add'>even</span> the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it <span class='add'>was</span>, and fled for their life.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid <span class='add'>it;</span> and came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence <span class='add'>also</span>, and went and hid <span class='add'>it</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day <span class='add'>is</span> a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us: now therefore come, that we may go and tell the king’s household.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> some…: Heb. we shall find punishment</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, <span class='add'>there was</span> no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they <span class='add'>were</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> And he called the porters; and they told <span class='add'>it</span> to the king’s house within. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>¶ And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we <span class='add'>be</span> hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> And one of his servants answered and said, Let <span class='add'>some</span> take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city, (behold, they <span class='add'>are</span> as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it: behold, <span class='add'>I say</span>, they <span class='add'>are</span> even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) and let us send and see.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> in the city: Heb. in it</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way <span class='add'>was</span> full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was <span class='add'>sold</span> for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>¶ And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people trode  upon him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, <span class='add'>if</span> the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died. </div><ul class='tnav'>
