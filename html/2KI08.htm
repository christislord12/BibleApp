And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this <span class='add'>is</span> the woman, and this <span class='add'>is</span> her son, whom Elisha restored to life.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that <span class='add'>was</span> hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> officer: or, eunuch</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>¶ And Elisha came to Damascus; and Ben-hadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand, and go, meet the man of God, and enquire of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels’ burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Ben-hadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> with…: Heb. in his hand</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest certainly recover: howbeit the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath shewed me that he shall surely die.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> stedfastly: Heb. and set it</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord?

And Elisha answered, The <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath shewed me that thou <span class='add'>shalt be</span> king over Syria.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to thee?
