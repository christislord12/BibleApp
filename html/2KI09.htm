Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>¶ So the young man, <span class='add'>even</span> the young man the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> And when he came, behold, the captains of the host <span class='add'>were</span> sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto which of all us? And he said, To thee, O captain.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, <span class='add'>even</span> over Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, at the hand of Jezebel.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and <span class='add'>there shall be</span> none to bury <span class='add'>her</span>.

And he said unto them, Ye know the man, and his communication.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> And they said, <span class='add'>It is</span> false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, I have anointed thee king over Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put <span class='add'>it</span> under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is king.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> is king: Heb. reigneth</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram.

And Jehu said, If it be your minds, <span class='add'>then</span> let none go forth <span class='add'>nor</span> escape out of the city to go to tell <span class='add'>it</span> in Jezreel.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Joram: Heb.

And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, <span class='add'>Is it</span> peace?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith the king, <span class='add'>Is it</span> peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he cometh not again.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and said, Thus saith the king, <span class='add'>Is it</span> peace?

And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts <span class='add'>are so</span> many?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, <span class='add'>There is</span> treachery, O Ahaziah.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.<a href="#FN10" class="notemark">†††<span class="popup"> drew…: Heb. filled his hand with a bow</span></a><a href="#FN11" class="notemark">‡‡‡<span class="popup"> sunk: Heb. bowed</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> Then said <span class='add'>Jehu</span> to Bidkar his captain, Take up, <span class='add'>and</span> cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> laid this burden upon him;  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.
