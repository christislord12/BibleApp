And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> How…: Heb.

And he smote him that he died.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> And David said unto him, Thy blood <span class='add'>be</span> upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the <span class='nd'>LORD’s</span> anointed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>¶ And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah <span class='add'>the use of</span> the bow: behold, <span class='add'>it is</span> written in the book of Jasher.)<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> of Jasher: or, of the upright</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> Tell <span class='add'>it</span> not in Gath, publish <span class='add'>it</span> not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> Ye mountains of Gilboa, <span class='add'>let there be</span> no dew, neither <span class='add'>let there be</span> rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, <span class='add'>as though he had</span> not <span class='add'>been</span> anointed with oil.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> Saul and Jonathan <span class='add'>were</span> lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> pleasant: or, sweet</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with <span class='add'>other</span> delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle!
