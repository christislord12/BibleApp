And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal’s wife the Carmelite.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> And his men that <span class='add'>were</span> with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah.
