And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David <span class='add'>rather</span> sent his servants unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Thinkest…: Heb.
