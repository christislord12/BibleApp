And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> The rich <span class='add'>man</span> had exceeding many flocks and herds:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> But the poor <span class='add'>man</span> had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> meat: Heb. morsel</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man’s lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> And David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, <span class='add'>As</span> the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> liveth, the man that hath done this <span class='add'>thing</span> shall surely die:<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> shall…: or, is worthy to die, or, is a son of death</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>¶ And Nathan said to David, Thou <span class='add'>art</span> the man. Thus saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And I gave thee thy master’s house, and thy master’s wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if <span class='add'>that had been</span> too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife <span class='add'>to be</span> thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> Thus saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give <span class='add'>them</span> unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> For thou didst <span class='add'>it</span> secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>. And Nathan said unto David, The <span class='nd'>LORD</span> also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> to blaspheme, the child also <span class='add'>that is</span> born unto thee shall surely die. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>¶ And Nathan departed unto his house. And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> struck the child that Uriah’s wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> fasted: Heb. fasted a fast</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> And the elders of his house arose, <span class='add'>and went</span> to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> vex: Heb. do hurt</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed <span class='add'>himself</span>, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> Then said his servants unto him, What thing <span class='add'>is</span> this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, <span class='add'>while it was</span> alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell <span class='add'>whether</span> <span class='nd'>GOD</span> will be gracious to me, that the child may live?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>¶ And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> loved him.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Jedidiah: that is, Beloved of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span></span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>¶ And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> it be called…: Heb. my name be called upon it</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> And he took their king’s crown from off his head, the weight whereof <span class='add'>was</span> a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was <span class='add'>set</span> on David’s head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> in great…: Heb. very great</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> And he brought forth the people that <span class='add'>were</span> therein, and put <span class='add'>them</span> under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem. </div><ul class='tnav'>
