And he said, Thy servant <span class='add'>is</span> of one of the tribes of Israel.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> came: Heb. to come</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters <span class='add'>are</span> good and right; but <span class='add'>there is</span> no man <span class='add'>deputed</span> of the king to hear thee.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> there…: or, none will hear thee from the king downward</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And it was <span class='add'>so</span>, that when any man came nigh <span class='add'>to him</span> to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>¶ And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, in Hebron.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>¶ But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, <span class='add'>that were</span> called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counsellor, from his city, <span class='add'>even</span> from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>¶ And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And David said unto all his servants that <span class='add'>were</span> with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not <span class='add'>else</span> escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> bring: Heb. thrust</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> And the king’s servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants <span class='add'>are ready to do</span> whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> appoint: Heb. choose</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> And the king went forth, and all his household after him.

And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that <span class='add'>were</span> with him.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> Kidron: Gr.
