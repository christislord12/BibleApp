And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now <span class='add'>thou art</span> worth ten thousand of us: therefore now <span class='add'>it is</span> better that thou succour us out of the city.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> care…: Heb. set their heart on us</span></a><a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> worth…: Heb. as ten thousand of us</span></a><a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> succour: Heb. be to succour or help</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, <span class='add'>Deal</span> gently for my sake with the young man, <span class='add'>even</span> with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>¶ So the people went out into the field against  Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand <span class='add'>men</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> devoured: Heb. multiplied to devour</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>¶ And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that <span class='add'>was</span> under him went away.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> And a certain man saw <span class='add'>it</span>, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest <span class='add'>him</span>, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten <span class='add'>shekels</span> of silver, and a girdle.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand <span class='add'>shekels</span> of silver in mine hand, <span class='add'>yet</span> would I not put forth mine hand against the king’s son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none <span class='add'>touch</span> the young man Absalom.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> receive: Heb. weigh upon mine hand</span></a><a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Beware…: Heb.

And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he <span class='add'>was</span> yet alive in the midst of the oak.<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> with…: Heb. before thee</span></a><a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§§<span class="popup"> midst: Heb. heart</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> And ten young men that bare Joab’s armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>¶ Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which <span class='add'>is</span> in the king’s dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom’s place. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>¶ Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath avenged him of his enemies.<a href="#FN9" class="notemark">***<span class="popup"> avenged…: Heb. judged him from the hand, etc</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king’s son is dead.<a href="#FN10" class="notemark">†††<span class="popup"> bear tidings this: Heb. be a man of tidings, etc</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?<a href="#FN11" class="notemark">‡‡‡<span class="popup"> howsoever: Heb. be what may</span></a><a href="#FN12" class="notemark">§§§<span class="popup"> ready: or, convenient</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But howsoever, <span class='add'>said he</span>, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he <span class='add'>be</span> alone, <span class='add'>there is</span> tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold <span class='add'>another</span> man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He <span class='add'>is</span> a good man, and cometh with good tidings.<a href="#FN13" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Me…: Heb.
