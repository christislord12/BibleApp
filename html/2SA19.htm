For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> In…: Heb.

And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>¶ And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle.
