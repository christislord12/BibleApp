And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> answered, <span class='add'>It is</span> for Saul, and for <span class='add'>his</span> bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> enquired…: Heb. sought the face, etc</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the Gibeonites <span class='add'>were</span> not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.)  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, <span class='add'>that</span> will I do for you.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> We will…: or, It is not silver nor gold that we have to do with Saul or his house, neither pertains it to us to kill, etc</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us <span class='add'>that</span> we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of Israel,<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> devised…: or, cut us off</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> in Gibeah of Saul, <span class='add'>whom</span> the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> did choose.
