</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>To Timothy, <span class='add'>my</span> dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, <span class='add'>and</span> peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> I thank God, whom I serve from <span class='add'>my</span> forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> Who hath saved us, and called <span class='add'>us</span> with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> Whereunto  I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found <span class='add'>me</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well. </div><ul class='tnav'>
