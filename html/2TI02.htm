And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master’s use, <span class='add'>and</span> prepared unto every good work.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all <span class='add'>men</span>, apt to teach, patient,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> And <span class='add'>that</span> they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will. </div><ul class='tnav'>
