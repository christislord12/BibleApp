<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 4</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span> And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> And they laid hands on them, and put <span class='add'>them</span> in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>¶ And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, <span class='add'>even</span> by him doth this man stand here before you whole.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>¶ Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them <span class='add'>is</span> manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot  deny <span class='add'>it</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> For we cannot  but speak the things which we have seen and heard.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all <span class='add'>men</span> glorified God for that which was done.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>¶ And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou <span class='add'>art</span> God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>¶ And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any <span class='add'>of them</span> that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> And laid <span class='add'>them</span> down at the apostles’ feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span> And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, <span class='add'>and</span> of the country of Cyprus,  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span> Having land, sold <span class='add'>it</span>, and brought the money, and laid <span class='add'>it</span> at the apostles’ feet. </div><ul class='tnav'>
