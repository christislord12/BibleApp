 <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> When Moses saw <span class='add'>it</span>, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold <span class='add'>it</span>, the voice of the Lord came unto him,  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> <span class='add'>Saying</span>, I <span class='add'>am</span> the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send <span class='add'>to be</span> a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span> He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>¶ This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span> This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and <span class='add'>with</span> our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us:  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span> To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust <span class='add'>him</span> from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span> Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for <span class='add'>as for</span> this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span> And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span> Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices <span class='add'>by the space of</span> forty years in the wilderness?  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span> Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span> Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span> Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span> Who found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span> But Solomon built him an house.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span> Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet,  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span> Heaven <span class='add'>is</span> my throne, and earth <span class='add'>is</span> my footstool: what house will ye build me? saith the Lord: or what <span class='add'>is</span> the place of my rest?  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span> Hath not my hand made all these things? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>¶ Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers <span class='add'>did</span>, so <span class='add'>do</span> ye.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span> Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers:  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span> Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept <span class='add'>it.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>¶ When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with <span class='add'>their</span> teeth.  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span> But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span> And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span> Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span> And cast <span class='add'>him</span> out of the city, and stoned <span class='add'>him</span>: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man’s feet, whose name was Saul.  <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span> And they stoned Stephen, calling upon <span class='add'>God</span>, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span> And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep. </div><ul class='tnav'>
