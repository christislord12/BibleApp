<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 8</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span> And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judæa and Samaria, except the apostles.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> And devout men carried Stephen <span class='add'>to his burial</span>, and made great lamentation over him.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed <span class='add'>them</span> to prison.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed <span class='add'>with them</span>: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And there was great joy in that city.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> Then laid they <span class='add'>their</span> hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles’ hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and <span class='add'>in</span> the bond of iniquity.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> And Philip ran thither to <span class='add'>him</span>, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span> And as they went on <span class='add'>their</span> way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, <span class='add'>here is</span> water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span> And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span> And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span> And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span> But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Cæsarea. </div><ul class='tnav'>
