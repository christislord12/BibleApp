 <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>¶ Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>¶ And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men <span class='add'>and</span> brethren, hearken unto me:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and <span class='add'>from</span> fornication, and <span class='add'>from</span> things strangled, and <span class='add'>from</span> blood.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; <span class='add'>namely</span>, Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> And they wrote <span class='add'>letters</span> by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren <span class='add'>send</span> greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia:  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, <span class='add'>Ye must</span> be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no <span class='add'>such</span> commandment:  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell <span class='add'>you</span> the same things by mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle:  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> <span class='add'>Which</span> when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed <span class='add'>them</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> And after they had tarried <span class='add'>there</span> a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>¶ And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, <span class='add'>and see</span> how they do.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span> And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span> But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span> And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span> And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span> And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches. </div><ul class='tnav'>
