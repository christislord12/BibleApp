And Gallio cared for none of those things. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>¶ And Paul <span class='add'>after this</span> tarried <span class='add'>there</span> yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn <span class='add'>his</span> head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> When they desired <span class='add'>him</span> to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> And when he had landed at Cæsarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> And after he had spent some time <span class='add'>there</span>, he departed, and went over <span class='add'>all</span> the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>¶ And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, <span class='add'>and</span> mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto <span class='add'>them</span>, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> For he mightily convinced the Jews, <span class='add'>and that</span> publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ. </div><ul class='tnav'>
