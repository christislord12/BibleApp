for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> There went with us also <span class='add'>certain</span> of the disciples of Cæsarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> And the <span class='add'>day</span> following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> And when they heard <span class='add'>it</span>, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise <span class='add'>their</span> children, neither to walk after the customs.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them;  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave <span class='add'>their</span> heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but <span class='add'>that</span> thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written <span class='add'>and</span> concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from <span class='add'>things</span> offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all <span class='add'>men</span> every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>(For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the doors were shut.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded <span class='add'>him</span> to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span> For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span> And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek?  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span> Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span> But Paul said, I am a man <span class='add'>which am</span> a Jew of Tarsus, <span class='add'>a city</span> in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span> And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spake unto <span class='add'>them</span> in the Hebrew tongue, saying, </div><ul class='tnav'>
