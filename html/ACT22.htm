And he said unto me, <span class='wj'> I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, <span class='wj'> Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt <span class='add'>there</span>,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> And saw him saying unto me, <span class='wj'> Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> And he said unto me, <span class='wj'> Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> And they gave him audience unto this word, and <span class='add'>then</span> lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a <span class='add'>fellow</span> from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> And as they cried out, and cast off <span class='add'>their</span> clothes, and threw dust into the air,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> When the centurion heard <span class='add'>that</span>, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was <span class='add'>free</span> born.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from <span class='add'>his</span> bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
