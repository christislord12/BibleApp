when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix’ room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound. </div><ul class='tnav'>
