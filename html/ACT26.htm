<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 26</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span> Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> Especially <span class='add'>because I know</span> thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> Unto which <span class='add'>promise</span> our twelve tribes, instantly serving <span class='add'>God</span> day and night, hope to come. For which hope’s sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against <span class='add'>them</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled <span class='add'>them</span> to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted <span class='add'>them</span> even unto strange cities.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, <span class='wj'> Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? <span class='add'>it is</span> hard for thee to kick against the pricks.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, <span class='wj'> I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee;</span>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Delivering thee from the people, and <span class='add'>from</span> the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,</span>  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> To open their eyes, <span class='add'> and</span> to turn <span class='add'>them</span> from darkness to light, and <span class='add'>from</span> the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judæa, and <span class='add'>then</span> to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill <span class='add'>me</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> That Christ should suffer, <span class='add'>and</span> that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Cæsar. </div><ul class='tnav'>
