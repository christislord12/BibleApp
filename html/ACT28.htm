<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 28</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span> And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid <span class='add'>them</span> on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> And when the barbarians saw the <span class='add'>venomous</span> beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded <span class='add'>us</span> with such things as were necessary. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> And landing at Syracuse, we tarried <span class='add'>there</span> three days.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men <span class='add'>and</span> brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> Who, when they had examined me, would have let <span class='add'>me</span> go, because there was no cause of death in me.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> But when the Jews spake against <span class='add'>it</span>, I was constrained to appeal unto Cæsar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see <span class='add'>you</span>, and to speak with <span class='add'>you</span>: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judæa concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning  this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into <span class='add'>his</span> lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and <span class='add'>out of</span> the prophets, from morning till evening.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with <span class='add'>their</span> eyes, and hear with <span class='add'>their</span> ears, and understand with <span class='add'>their</span> heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and <span class='add'>that</span> they will hear it.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
