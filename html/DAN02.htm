So they came and stood before the king.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> O king…: (Chaldee, to the end of chapter seven)</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> cut…: Chaldee, made pieces</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> rewards: or, fee</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> gain: Chaldee, buy</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, <span class='add'>there is but</span> one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>¶ The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king’s matter: therefore <span class='add'>there is</span> no king, lord, nor ruler, <span class='add'>that</span> asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>it is</span> a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise <span class='add'>men</span> of Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> And the decree went forth that the wise <span class='add'>men</span> should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>¶ Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king’s guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise <span class='add'>men</span> of Babylon:<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> answered…: Chaldee, returned</span></a><a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> captain…: or, chief marshal: Chaldee, chief of the executioners, or, slaughtermen</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> He answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain, Why <span class='add'>is</span> the decree <span class='add'>so</span> hasty from the king?
