Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream <span class='add'>be</span> to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached  unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> Whose leaves <span class='add'>were</span> fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it <span class='add'>was</span> meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>It <span class='add'>is</span> thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and <span class='add'>let</span> his portion <span class='add'>be</span> with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> This <span class='add'>is</span> the interpretation, O king, and this <span class='add'>is</span> the decree of the most High, which is come upon my lord the king:  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> a lengthening…: or, an healing of thine error</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>¶ All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> in: or, upon</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty?
