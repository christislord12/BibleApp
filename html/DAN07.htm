So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> These great beasts, which are four, <span class='add'>are</span> four kings, <span class='add'>which</span> shall arise out of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> most…: Chaldee, high ones, that is, things, or, places</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth <span class='add'>were of</span> iron, and his nails <span class='add'>of</span> brass; <span class='add'>which</span> devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;<a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§§<span class="popup"> from…: Chaldee, from all those</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> And of the ten horns that <span class='add'>were</span> in his head, and <span class='add'>of</span> the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even <span class='add'>of</span> that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look <span class='add'>was</span> more stout than his fellows.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> And the ten horns out of this kingdom <span class='add'>are</span> ten kings <span class='add'>that</span> shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> And he shall speak <span class='add'>great</span> words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy <span class='add'>it</span> unto the end.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom <span class='add'>is</span> an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.<a href="#FN9" class="notemark">***<span class="popup"> dominions: or, rulers</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> Hitherto <span class='add'>is</span> the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart. </div><ul class='tnav'>
