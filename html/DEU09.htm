 <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> Understand therefore this day, that the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> thy God <span class='add'>is</span> he which goeth over before thee; <span class='add'>as</span> a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath said unto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> doth drive them out from before thee.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> Understand therefore, that the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou <span class='add'>art</span> a stiffnecked people. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>¶ Remember, <span class='add'>and</span> forget not, how thou provokedst the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> Also in Horeb ye provoked the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> to wrath, so that the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> was angry with you to have destroyed you.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, <span class='add'>even</span> the tables of the covenant which the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> delivered  unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them <span class='add'>was written</span> according to all the words, which the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, <span class='add'>that</span> the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> gave me the two tables of stone, <span class='add'>even</span> the tables of the covenant.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted <span class='add'>themselves;</span> they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> Furthermore the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it <span class='add'>is</span> a stiffnecked people:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant <span class='add'>were</span> in my two hands.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> your God, <span class='add'>and</span> had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> had commanded you.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> And I fell down before the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, to provoke him to anger.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> was wroth against you to destroy you. But the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hearkened unto me at that time also.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, <span class='add'>and</span> ground <span class='add'>it</span> very small, <span class='add'>even</span> until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> to wrath.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> Likewise when the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> Ye have been rebellious against the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> from the day that I knew you.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> Thus I fell down before the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> forty days and forty nights, as I fell down <span class='add'>at the first;</span> because the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> had said he would destroy you.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> I prayed therefore unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and said, O Lord <span class='nd'>GOD</span>, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Yet they <span class='add'>are</span> thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm. </div><ul class='tnav'>
