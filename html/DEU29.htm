 <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> The great temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs, and those great miracles:  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> Yet the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes are not waxen old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink: that ye might know that I <span class='add'>am</span> the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> your God.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle, and we smote them:  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may prosper in all that ye do. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>¶ Ye stand this day all of you before the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> your God;
