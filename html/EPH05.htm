He that loveth his wife loveth himself.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife <span class='add'>see</span> that she reverence <span class='add'>her</span> husband. </div><ul class='tnav'>
