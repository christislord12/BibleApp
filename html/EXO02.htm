And she had compassion on him, and said, This <span class='add'>is one</span> of the Hebrews’ children.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child’s mother.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> And Pharaoh’s daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give <span class='add'>thee</span> thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Moses: that is, Drawn out</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>¶ And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that <span class='add'>there was</span> no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> a prince: Heb. a man, a prince</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses.
