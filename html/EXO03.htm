And he said, Here <span class='add'>am</span> I.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest <span class='add'>is</span> holy ground.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> Moreover he said, I <span class='add'>am</span> the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>¶ And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which <span class='add'>are</span> in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>¶ And Moses said unto God, Who <span class='add'>am</span> I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this <span class='add'>shall be</span> a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> And Moses said unto God, Behold, <span class='add'>when</span> I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What <span class='add'>is</span> his name? what shall I say unto them?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this <span class='add'>is</span> my name for ever, and this <span class='add'>is</span> my memorial unto all generations. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and <span class='add'>seen</span> that which is done to you in Egypt:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days’ journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> our God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>¶ And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> no…: or, but by strong hand</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put <span class='add'>them</span> upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> the Egyptians: or, Egypt</span></a> </div><ul class='tnav'>
