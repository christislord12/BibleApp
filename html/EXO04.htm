And he said, A rod.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> That they may believe that the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>¶ And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom.
