And they did so. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>¶ And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hardened  the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses <span class='add'>and</span> chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>¶ And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> And they said unto Moses, Because <span class='add'>there were</span> no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> <span class='add'>Is</span> not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For <span class='add'>it had been</span> better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>¶ And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, which he will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> for the…: or, for whereas ye have seen the Egyptians to day</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> The <span class='nd'>LORD</span> shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>¶ And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me?
