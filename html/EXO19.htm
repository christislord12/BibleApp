These <span class='add'>are</span> the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>¶ And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> commanded him.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And all the people answered together, and said, All that the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath spoken we will do.
