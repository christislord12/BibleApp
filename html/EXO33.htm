And it came to pass, <span class='add'>that</span> every one which sought the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which <span class='add'>was</span> without the camp.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, <span class='add'>that</span> all the people rose up, and stood every man <span class='add'>at</span> his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood <span class='add'>at</span> the door of the tabernacle, and <span class='add'>the <span class='nd'>LORD</span></span> talked with Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand <span class='add'>at</span> the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man <span class='add'>in</span> his tent door.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>¶ And Moses said unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation <span class='add'>is</span> thy people.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And he said, My presence shall go <span class='add'>with thee</span>, and I will give thee rest.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> And he said unto him, If thy presence go not <span class='add'>with me</span>, carry us not up hence.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? <span class='add'>is it</span> not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that <span class='add'>are</span> upon the face of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said, Behold, <span class='add'>there is</span> a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen. </div><ul class='tnav'>
