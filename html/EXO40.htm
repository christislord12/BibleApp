that he may minister unto me in the priest’s office.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest’s office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> Thus did Moses: according to all that the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> commanded him, so did he. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>¶ And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first <span class='add'>day</span> of the month, <span class='add'>that</span> the tabernacle was reared up.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his pillars.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> commanded Moses. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>¶ And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> commanded Moses. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>¶ And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> And he set the bread in order upon it before the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>; as the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> had commanded Moses. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>¶ And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> And he lighted the lamps before the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>; as the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> commanded Moses. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>¶ And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail:  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> And he burnt sweet incense thereon;

as the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> commanded Moses. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>¶ And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash <span class='add'>withal</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat:  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>¶ Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> filled the tabernacle.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> filled the tabernacle.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span> And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> went onward: Heb. journeyed</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span> But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span> For the cloud of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> <span class='add'>was</span> upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys. </div><ul class='tnav'>
