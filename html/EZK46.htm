but on the sabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of <span class='add'>that</span> gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> in the sabbaths and in the new moons.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> in the sabbath day <span class='add'>shall be</span> six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> And the meat offering <span class='add'>shall be</span> an ephah for a ram, and the meat offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> as he…: Heb. the gift of his hand</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> And in the day of the new moon <span class='add'>it shall be</span> a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they shall be without blemish.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> And he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs according as his hand shall attain unto, and an hin of oil to an ephah.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of <span class='add'>that</span> gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>¶ But when the people of the land shall come before the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> in the solemn feasts, he that entereth in by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth over against it.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> And the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go in; and when they go forth, shall go forth.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall be an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram, and to the lambs as he is able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, <span class='add'>one</span> shall then open him the gate that looketh toward the east, and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he did on the sabbath day: then he shall go forth; and after his going forth <span class='add'>one</span> shall shut the gate.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> <span class='add'>of</span> a lamb of the first year without blemish: thou shalt prepare it every morning.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> of the…: Heb. a son of his year</span></a><a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> every…: Heb. morning by morning</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of an hin of oil, to temper with the fine flour; a meat offering continually by a perpetual ordinance unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat offering, and the oil, every morning <span class='add'>for</span> a continual burnt offering. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>¶ Thus saith the Lord <span class='nd'>GOD</span>;
