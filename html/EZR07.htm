the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he <span class='add'>was</span> a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God of Israel had given: and the king granted  him all his request, according to the hand of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> his God upon him.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> And there went up <span class='add'>some</span> of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which <span
