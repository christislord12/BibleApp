God forbid.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness <span class='add'>come</span> by the law, then Christ is dead in vain. </div><ul class='tnav'>
