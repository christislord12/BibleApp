He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> And this I say, <span class='add'>that</span> the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> For if the inheritance <span class='add'>be</span> of the law, <span class='add'>it is</span> no more of promise: but God gave <span class='add'>it</span> to Abraham by promise.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> Wherefore then <span class='add'>serveth</span> the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; <span class='add'>and it was</span> ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> Now a mediator is not <span class='add'>a mediator</span> of one, but God is one.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> <span class='add'>Is</span> the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster <span class='add'>to bring us</span> unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> And if ye <span class='add'>be</span> Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise. </div><ul class='tnav'>
