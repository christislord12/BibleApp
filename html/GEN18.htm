And they said, So do, as thou hast said.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> comfort: Heb. stay</span></a><a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> are…: Heb. you have passed</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead <span class='add'>it</span>, and make cakes upon the hearth.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Make ready…: Heb.

And he said, Behold, in the tent.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard <span class='add'>it</span> in the tent door, which <span class='add'>was</span> behind him.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> Now Abraham and Sarah <span class='add'>were</span> old <span class='add'>and</span> well stricken in age; <span class='add'>and</span> it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> Is any thing too hard for the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>¶ And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, to do justice and judgment; that the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>¶ And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that <span class='add'>are</span> therein?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which <span class='add'>am but</span> dust and ashes:  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for <span class='add'>lack of</span> five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy <span class='add'>it</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do <span class='add'>it</span> for forty’s sake.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> And he said <span class='add'>unto him</span>, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do <span class='add'>it</span>, if I find thirty there.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy <span class='add'>it</span> for twenty’s sake.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy <span class='add'>it</span> for ten’s sake.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place. </div><ul class='tnav'>
