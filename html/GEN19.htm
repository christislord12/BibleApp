And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>¶ But before they lay down, the men of the city, <span class='add'>even</span> the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where <span class='add'>are</span> the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as <span class='add'>is</span> good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> And they said, Stand back. And they said <span class='add'>again</span>, This one <span class='add'>fellow</span> came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, <span class='add'>even</span> Lot, and came near to break the door.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> And they smote the men that <span class='add'>were</span> at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>¶ And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring <span class='add'>them</span> out of this place:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>; and the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath sent us to destroy it.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>¶ And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> are here: Heb. are found</span></a><a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> iniquity: or, punishment</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>¶ And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> Behold now, this city <span class='add'>is</span> near to flee unto, and it <span class='add'>is</span> a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (<span class='add'>is</span> it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> thee: Heb. thy face</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither.
