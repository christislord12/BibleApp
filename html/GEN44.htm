And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> <span class='add'>And</span> when they were gone out of the city, <span class='add'>and</span> not <span class='add'>yet</span> far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> <span class='add'>Is</span> not this <span class='add'>it</span> in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> divineth: or, maketh trial?</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>¶ And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord’s house silver or gold?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord’s bondmen.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> And he said, Now also <span class='add'>let</span> it <span class='add'>be</span> according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> And he searched, <span class='add'>and</span> began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>¶ And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph’s house; for he <span class='add'>was</span> yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> And Joseph said unto them, What deed <span class='add'>is</span> this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> divine: or, make trial?</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we <span class='add'>are</span> my lord’s servants, both we, and <span class='add'>he</span> also with whom the cup is found.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> And he said, God forbid that I should do so: <span class='add'>but</span> the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>¶ Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou <span class='add'>art</span> even as Pharaoh.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for <span class='add'>if</span> he should leave his father, <span class='add'>his father</span> would die.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> And our father said, Go again, <span class='add'>and</span> buy us a little food.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man’s face, except our youngest brother <span class='add'>be</span> with us.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two <span class='add'>sons:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad <span class='add'>be</span> not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad’s life;  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad <span class='add'>is</span> not <span class='add'>with us</span>, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad <span class='add'>be</span> not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> come…: Heb. find my father</span></a> </div><ul class='tnav'>
