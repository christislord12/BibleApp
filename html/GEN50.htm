Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>¶ And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father’s house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which <span class='add'>is</span> beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This <span class='add'>is</span> a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which <span class='add'>is</span> beyond Jordan.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Abel-mizraim: that is, The mourning of the Egyptians</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>¶ And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>¶ And when Joseph’s brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> sent: Heb. charged</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father.
