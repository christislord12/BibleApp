And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> But unto the Son <span class='add'>he saith</span>, Thy throne, O God, <span class='add'>is</span> for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness <span class='add'>is</span> the sceptre of thy kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, <span class='add'>even</span> thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation? </div><ul class='tnav'>
