For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing <span class='add'>that is</span> not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> For it became him, for whom <span class='add'>are</span> all things, and by whom <span class='add'>are</span> all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified <span class='add'>are</span> all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> For verily he took not on <span class='add'>him the nature of</span> angels; but he took on <span class='add'>him</span> the seed of Abraham.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto <span class='add'>his</span> brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things <span class='add'>pertaining</span> to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted. </div><ul class='tnav'>
