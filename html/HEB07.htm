<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 7</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span> For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> Now consider how great this man <span class='add'>was</span>, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And here men that die receive tithes; but there he <span class='add'>receiveth them</span>, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need <span class='add'>was there</span> that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> For <span class='add'>it is</span> evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> For he testifieth, Thou <span class='add'>art</span> a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope <span class='add'>did</span>; by the which we draw nigh unto God.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> And inasmuch as not without an oath <span class='add'>he was made priest</span>:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou <span class='add'>art</span> a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> But this <span class='add'>man</span>, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> For such an high priest became us, <span class='add'>who is</span> holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people’s: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, <span class='add'>maketh</span> the Son, who is consecrated for evermore. </div><ul class='tnav'>
