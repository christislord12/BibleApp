<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 11</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span> Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> For by it the elders obtained a good report.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> But without faith <span class='add'>it is</span> impossible to please <span class='add'>him</span>: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and <span class='add'>that</span> he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as <span class='add'>in</span> a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker <span class='add'>is</span> God.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, <span class='add'>so many</span> as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of <span class='add'>them</span>, and embraced <span class='add'>them</span>, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> And truly, if they had been mindful of that <span class='add'>country</span> from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> But now they desire a better <span class='add'>country</span>, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten <span class='add'>son</span>,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> Accounting that God <span class='add'>was</span> able to raise <span class='add'>him</span> up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, <span class='add'>leaning</span> upon the top of his staff.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw <span class='add'>he was</span> a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king’s commandment.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter;  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry <span class='add'>land</span>: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and <span class='add'>of</span> Barak, and <span class='add'>of</span> Samson, and <span class='add'>of</span> Jephthae; <span class='add'>of</span> David also, and Samuel, and <span class='add'>of</span> the prophets:  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span> And others had trial of <span class='add'>cruel</span> mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span> They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>(Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and <span class='add'>in</span> mountains, and <span class='add'>in</span> dens and caves of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span> God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect. </div><ul class='tnav'>
