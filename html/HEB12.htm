For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more <span class='add'>shall not</span> we <span class='add'>escape</span>, if we turn away from him that <span class='add'>speaketh</span> from heaven:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> And this <span class='add'>word</span>, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> For our God <span class='add'>is</span> a consuming fire. </div><ul class='tnav'>
