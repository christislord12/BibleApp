For <span class='add'>it is</span> a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of <span class='add'>our</span> lips giving thanks to his name.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that <span class='add'>is</span> unprofitable for you. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> But I beseech <span class='add'>you</span> the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom <span class='add'>be</span> glory for ever and ever.
