your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered perverseness.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> None calleth for justice, nor <span class='add'>any</span> pleadeth for truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> They hatch cockatrice’ eggs, and weave the spider’s web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> cockatrice’: or, adder’s</span></a><a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> crushed…: or, sprinkled is as if there brake out a viper</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works <span class='add'>are</span> works of iniquity, and the act of violence <span class='add'>is</span> in their hands.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts <span class='add'>are</span> thoughts of iniquity;

<span class='add'>we are</span> in desolate places as dead <span class='add'>men</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for judgment, but <span class='add'>there is</span> none;

and he <span class='add'>that</span> departeth from evil maketh himself a prey: and the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> saw <span class='add'>it</span>, and it displeased him that <span class='add'>there was</span> no judgment.<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> maketh…: or, is accounted mad</span></a><a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> it displeased…: Heb. it was evil in his eyes</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>¶ And he saw that <span class='add'>there was</span> no man, and wondered that <span class='add'>there was</span> no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it sustained him.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance <span class='add'>for</span> clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloke.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> According to <span class='add'>their</span> deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his adversaries, recompence to his enemies;
