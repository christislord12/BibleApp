Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one <span class='add'>point</span>, he is guilty of all.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> What <span class='add'>doth it</span> profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be <span class='add'>ye</span> warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what <span class='add'>doth it</span> profit?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent <span class='add'>them</span> out another way?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also. </div><ul class='tnav'>
