If any man offend not in word, the same <span class='add'>is</span> a perfect man, <span class='add'>and</span> able also to bridle the whole body.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> Behold, we put bits in the horses’ mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> Behold also the ships, which though <span class='add'>they be</span> so great, and <span class='add'>are</span> driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> And the tongue <span class='add'>is</span> a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> But the tongue can no man tame; <span class='add'>it is</span> an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet <span class='add'>water</span> and bitter?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so <span class='add'>can</span> no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> Who <span class='add'>is</span> a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> This wisdom descendeth not from above, but <span class='add'>is</span> earthly, sensual, devilish.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> For where envying and strife <span class='add'>is</span>, there <span class='add'>is</span> confusion and every evil work.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, <span class='add'>and</span> easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace. </div><ul class='tnav'>
