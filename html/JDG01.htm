So Simeon went with him.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> And Judah went up; and the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> And Adoni-bezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered <span class='add'>their meat</span> under my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> their thumbs…: Heb. the thumbs of their hands and of their feet</span></a><a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> gathered: or, gleaned</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>¶ And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> valley: or, low country</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before <span class='add'>was</span> Kirjath-arba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before <span class='add'>was</span> Kirjath-sepher:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And it came to pass, when she came <span class='add'>to him</span>, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off <span class='add'>her</span> ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water.
