but they shall be <span class='add'>as thorns</span> in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> And it came to pass, when the angel of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> spake these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Bochim: that is, Weepers</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>¶ And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> And the people served the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, that he did for Israel.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> outlived: Heb. prolonged days after</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, died, <span class='add'>being</span> an hundred and ten years old.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Timnath-heres: also called, Timnath-serah</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>¶ And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and served Baalim:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> And they forsook the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that <span class='add'>were</span> round about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> to anger.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> And they forsook the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and served Baal and Ashtaroth. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>¶ And the anger of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> was against them for evil, as the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> had said, and as the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> had sworn unto them: and they were greatly distressed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>¶ Nevertheless the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> delivered: Heb. saved</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>;
