And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>¶ And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> Now Heber the Kenite, <span class='add'>which was</span> of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which <span class='add'>is</span> by Kedesh.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, <span class='add'>even</span> nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that <span class='add'>were</span> with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> together: Heb. by cry, or, proclamation</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this <span class='add'>is</span> the day in which the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> discomfited  Sisera, and all <span class='add'>his</span> chariots, and all <span class='add'>his</span> host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off <span class='add'>his</span> chariot, and fled away on his feet.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; <span class='add'>and</span> there was not a man left.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> a man: Heb. unto one</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for <span class='add'>there was</span> peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>¶ And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not.

So he died.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> and took: Heb. and put</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> And, behold, as Barak pursued  Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest.
