And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said unto Gideon, The people <span class='add'>are</span> yet <span class='add'>too</span> many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, <span class='add'>that</span> of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> So he brought down the people unto the water: and the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> And the number of them that lapped, <span class='add'>putting</span> their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let all the <span class='add'>other</span> people go every man unto his place.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all <span class='add'>the rest of</span> Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>¶ And it came to pass the same night, that the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine hand.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that <span class='add'>were</span> in the host.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> armed men: or, ranks by five</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels <span class='add'>were</span> without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> And when Gideon was come, behold, <span class='add'>there was</span> a man that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And his fellow answered and said, This <span class='add'>is</span> nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: <span class='add'>for</span> into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>¶ And it was <span class='add'>so</span>, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> interpretation: Heb. breaking</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> And he divided the three hundred men <span class='add'>into</span> three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man’s hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> a trumpet…: Heb. trumpets in the hand of all of them</span></a><a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> lamps: or, firebrands, or, torches</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be <span class='add'>that</span>, as I do, so shall ye do.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that <span class='add'>are</span> with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, <span class='add'>The sword</span> of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and of Gideon. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>¶ So Gideon, and the hundred men that <span class='add'>were</span> with him, came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers that <span class='add'>were</span> in their hands.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow <span class='add'>withal:</span> and they cried, The sword of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and of Gideon.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> And they stood every man in his place round about the camp: and all the host ran, and cried, and fled.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> set every man’s sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Beth-shittah in Zererath, <span class='add'>and</span> to the border of Abel-meholah, unto Tabbath.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> in: or, toward</span></a><a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> border: Heb. lip</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>¶ And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto Beth-barah and Jordan.
