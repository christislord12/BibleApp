But her father would not suffer him to go in.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: <span class='add'>is</span> not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> take…: Heb. let her be thine</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>¶ And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> more…: or, blameless from the Philistines though, etc</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> firebrands: or, torches</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> And when he had set the brands on fire, he let <span class='add'>them</span> go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards <span class='add'>and</span> olives. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>¶ Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>¶ And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>¶ Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines <span class='add'>are</span> rulers over us? what <span class='add'>is</span> this <span class='add'>that</span> thou hast done unto us?
