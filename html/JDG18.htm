now therefore consider what ye have to do.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, <span class='add'>even</span> unto the house of Micah, and saluted him.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> saluted…: Heb. asked him of peace</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, which <span class='add'>were</span> of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of the gate.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, <span class='add'>and</span> came in thither, <span class='add'>and</span> took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men <span class='add'>that were</span> appointed with weapons of war.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> And these went into Micah’s house, and fetched the carved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image.
