Then said the children of Israel, Tell <span class='add'>us</span>, how was this wickedness?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that <span class='add'>belongeth</span> to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> the Levite: Heb. the man the Levite</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about upon me by night, <span class='add'>and</span> thought to have slain me: and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> forced: Heb. humbled</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Behold, ye <span class='add'>are</span> all children of Israel; give here your advice and counsel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>¶ And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any <span class='add'>of us</span> go to his tent, neither will we any <span class='add'>of us</span> turn into his house.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But now this <span class='add'>shall be</span> the thing which we will do to Gibeah; <span class='add'>we will go up</span> by lot against it;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> And we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> knit…: Heb. fellows</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>¶ And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness <span class='add'>is</span> this that is done among you?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> Now therefore deliver <span class='add'>us</span> the men, the children of Belial, which <span class='add'>are</span> in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel.
