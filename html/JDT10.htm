Then they worshipped God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And she said unto them, Command the gates of the city to be opened unto me, that I may go forth to accomplish the things whereof ye have spoken with me. So they commanded the young men to open unto her, as she had spoken. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And when they had done so, Judith went out, she, and her maid with her; and the men of the city looked after her, until she was gone down the mountain, and till she had passed the valley, and could see her no more. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Thus they went straight forth in the valley: and the first watch of the Assyrians met her, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And took her, and asked her, Of what people art thou? and whence comest thou? and whither goest thou? And she said, I am a woman of the Hebrews, and am fled from them: for they shall be given you to be consumed: </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And I am coming before Holofernes the chief captain of your army, to declare words of truth; and I will shew him a way, whereby he shall go, and win all the hill country, without losing the body or life of any one of his men. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Now when the men heard her words, and beheld her countenance, they wondered greatly at her beauty, and said unto her, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Thou hast saved thy life, in that thou hast hasted to come down to the presence of our lord: now therefore come to his tent, and some of us shall conduct thee, until they have delivered thee to his hands. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And when thou standest before him, be not afraid in thine heart, but shew unto him according to thy word; and he will entreat thee well. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then they chose out of them an hundred men to accompany her and her maid; and they brought her to the tent of Holofernes. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then was there a concourse throughout all the camp: for her coming was noised among the tents, and they came about her, as she stood without the tent of Holofernes, till they told him of her. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And they wondered at her beauty, and admired the children of Israel because of her, and every one said to his neighbour, Who would despise this people, that have among them such women? surely it is not good that one man of them be left who being let go might deceive the whole earth. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And they that lay near Holofernes went out, and all his servants and they brought her into the tent. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Now Holofernes rested upon his bed under a canopy, which was woven with purple, and gold, and emeralds, and precious stones. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So they shewed him of her; and he came out before his tent with silver lamps going before him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And when Judith was come before him and his servants they all marvelled at the beauty of her countenance; and she fell down upon her face, and did reverence unto him: and his servants took her up. </div><ul class='tnav'>
