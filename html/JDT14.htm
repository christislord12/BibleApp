Then Judith declared unto him in the midst of the people all that she had done, from the day that she went forth until that hour she spake unto them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And when she had left off speaking, the people shouted with a loud voice, and made a joyful noise in their city. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And when Achior had seen all that the God of Israel had done, he believed in God greatly, and circumcised the flesh of his foreskin, and was joined unto the house of Israel unto this day. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And as soon as the morning arose, they hanged the head of Holofernes upon the wall, and every man took his weapons, and they went forth by bands unto the straits of the mountain. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But when the Assyrians saw them, they sent to their leaders, which came to their captains and tribunes, and to every one of their rulers. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So they came to Holofernes’ tent, and said to him that had the charge of all his things, Waken now our lord: for the slaves have been bold to come down against us to battle, that they may be utterly destroyed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then went in Bagoas, and knocked at the door of the tent; for he thought that he had slept with Judith. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But because none answered, he opened it, and went into the bedchamber, and found him cast upon the floor dead, and his head was taken from him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Therefore he cried with a loud voice, with weeping, and sighing, and a mighty cry, and rent his garments. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>After he went into the tent where Judith lodged: and when he found her not, he leaped out to the people, and cried, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>These slaves have dealt treacherously; one woman of the Hebrews hath brought shame upon the house of king Nabuchodonosor: for, behold, Holofernes lieth upon the ground without a head. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>When the captains of the Assyrians’ army heard these words, they rent their coats and their minds were wonderfully troubled, and there was a cry and a very great noise throughout the camp. </div><ul class='tnav'>
