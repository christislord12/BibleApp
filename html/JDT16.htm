the Lord Almighty will take vengeance of them in the day of judgment, in putting fire and worms in their flesh; and they shall feel them, and weep for ever. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Now as soon as they entered into Jerusalem, they worshipped the Lord; and as soon as the people were purified, they offered their burnt offerings, and their free offerings, and their gifts. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Judith also dedicated all the stuff of Holofernes, which the people had given her, and gave the canopy, which she had taken out of his bedchamber, for a gift unto the Lord. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>So the people continued feasting in Jerusalem before the sanctuary for the space of three months and Judith remained with them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>After this time every one returned to his own inheritance, and Judith went to Bethulia, and remained in her own possession, and was in her time honourable in all the country. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And many desired her, but none knew her all the days of her life, after that Manasses her husband was dead, and was gathered to his people. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But she increased more and more in honour, and waxed old in her husband’s house, being an hundred and five years old, and made her maid free; so she died in Bethulia: and they buried her in the cave of her husband Manasses. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the house of Israel lamented her seven days: and before she died, she did distribute her goods to all them that were nearest of kindred to Manasses her husband, and to them that were the nearest of her kindred. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And there was none that made the children of Israel any more afraid in the days of Judith, nor a long time after her death. </div><ul class='tnav'>
