Then said Jeremiah unto him, The <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath not called thy name Pashur, but Magor-missabib.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Magor-missabib: that is, Fear round about</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> For thus saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends: and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold <span class='add'>it:</span> and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive into Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all the labours thereof, and all the precious things thereof, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, which shall spoil them, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity: and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and shalt be buried there, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied lies. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>¶ O <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived: thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one mocketh me.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> was deceived: or, was enticed</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> For since I spake, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil; because the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> was made a reproach unto me, and a derision, daily.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name.
