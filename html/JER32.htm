Then I knew that this <span class='add'>was</span> the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle’s son, that <span class='add'>was</span> in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, <span class='add'>even</span> seventeen shekels of silver.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> seventeen…: or, seven shekels and ten pieces of silver</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed <span class='add'>it</span>, and took witnesses, and weighed <span class='add'>him</span> the money in the balances.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> subscribed…: Heb. wrote in the book</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> So I took the evidence of the purchase, <span class='add'>both</span> that which was sealed <span class='add'>according</span> to the law and custom, and that which was open:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle’s <span class='add'>son</span>, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>¶ And I charged Baruch before them, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> Thus saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> For thus saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts, the God of Israel;
