So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read <span class='add'>it</span> in their ears.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and other, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote <span class='add'>them</span> with ink in the book.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>¶ And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of Elishama the scribe’s chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and <span class='add'>there was a fire</span> on the hearth burning before him.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And it came to pass, <span class='add'>that</span> when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast <span class='add'>it</span> into the fire that <span class='add'>was</span> on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that <span class='add'>was</span> on the hearth.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, <span class='add'>neither</span> the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hid them.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> of Hammelech: or, of the king</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>¶ Then the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>; Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> Therefore thus saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> punish: Heb. visit upon</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>¶ Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were added besides unto them many like words.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> like: Heb. as they</span></a> </div><ul class='tnav'>
