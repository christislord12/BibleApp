And in the dungeon <span class='add'>there was</span> no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> of Hammelech: or, of the king</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>¶ Now when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> Ebed-melech went forth out of the king’s house, and spake to the king, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is: for <span class='add'>there is</span> no more bread in the city.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> he is like…: Heb. he will die</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> with thee: Heb. in thine hand</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> So Ebed-melech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now <span class='add'>these</span> old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>¶ Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that <span class='add'>is</span> in the house of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>: and the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> third: or, principal</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare <span class='add'>it</span> unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, wilt thou not hearken unto me?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, <span class='add'>As</span> the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of Babylon’s princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thine house:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver <span class='add'>thee</span>. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, which I speak unto thee: so it shall be well unto thee, and thy soul shall live.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> But if thou refuse to go forth, this <span class='add'>is</span> the word that the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> hath shewed me:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah’s house <span class='add'>shall be</span> brought forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, and those <span class='add'>women</span> shall say, Thy friends have set thee on, and have prevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire, <span class='add'>and</span> they are turned away back.<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Thy friends: Heb.
