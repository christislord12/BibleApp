 <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> wickedness…: Heb. wickednesses, or, punishments, etc</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> They are not humbled <span class='add'>even</span> unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> humbled: Heb. contrite</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>¶ Therefore thus saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed, <span class='add'>and</span> fall in the land of Egypt; they shall <span class='add'>even</span> be consumed by the sword <span class='add'>and</span> by the famine: they shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine: and they shall be an execration, <span class='add'>and</span> an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> So that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should return into the land of Judah, to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return but such as shall escape.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> have…: Heb. lift up their soul</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>¶ Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered  Jeremiah, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> <span class='add'>As for</span> the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, we will not hearken unto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for <span class='add'>then</span> had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> queen…: or, frame of heaven</span></a><a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> victuals: Heb. bread</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all <span class='add'>things</span>, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings unto her, without our men?<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> men: or, husbands?</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>¶ Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people which had given him <span class='add'>that</span> answer, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> remember them, and came it <span class='add'>not</span> into his mind?
