can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> Jesus answered, <span class='wj'> Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and <span class='add'>of</span> the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> Jesus answered and said unto him, <span class='wj'> Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you <span class='add'>of</span> heavenly things?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, <span class='add'>even</span> the Son of man which is in heaven.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>¶ And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>¶ For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>¶ He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>¶ After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judæa; and there he tarried with them, and baptized. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>¶ And John also was baptizing in Ænon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> For John was not yet cast into prison. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>¶ Then there arose a question between <span class='add'>some</span> of John’s disciples and the Jews about purifying.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all <span class='add'>men</span> come to him.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> He must increase, but I <span class='add'>must</span> decrease.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure <span class='add'>unto him</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span> He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
