<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 4</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span> When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> He left Judæa, and departed again into Galilee.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> And he must needs go through Samaria.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with <span class='add'>his</span> journey, sat thus on the well: <span class='add'>and</span> it was about the sixth hour.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, <span class='wj'> Give me to drink.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> Jesus answered and said unto her, <span class='wj'> If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> Jesus answered and said unto her, <span class='wj'> Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> Jesus saith unto her, <span class='wj'> Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, <span class='wj'> Thou hast well said, I have no husband:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> Jesus saith unto her, <span class='wj'> Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> God <span class='add'>is</span> a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship <span class='add'>him</span> in spirit and in truth.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> Jesus saith unto her, <span class='wj'> I that speak unto thee am <span class='add'>he.</span></span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>¶ And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> Then they went out of the city, and came unto him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>¶ In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> But he said unto them, <span class='wj'> I have meat to eat that ye know not of.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him <span class='add'>ought</span> to eat?  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> Jesus saith unto them, <span class='wj'> My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Say not ye, There are yet four months, and <span class='add'>then</span> cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>¶ And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span> So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span> And many more believed because of his own word;  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span> And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard <span class='add'>him</span> ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>¶ Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span> For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span> Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilæans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span> So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span> When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judæa into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span> Then said Jesus unto him, <span class='wj'> Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span> The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span> Jesus saith unto him, <span class='wj'> Go thy way; thy son liveth.</span> And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span> And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told <span class='add'>him</span>, saying, Thy son liveth.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span> Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span> So the father knew that <span class='add'>it was</span> at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span> This <span class='add'>is</span> again the second miracle <span class='add'>that</span> Jesus did, when he was come out of Judæa into Galilee. </div><ul class='tnav'>
