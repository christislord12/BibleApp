He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;</span>  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,</span>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>¶ There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>¶ But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>¶ Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>I receive not honour from men.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> I am come in my Father’s name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that <span class='add'>cometh</span> from God only?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is <span class='add'>one</span> that accuseth you, <span class='add'>even</span> Moses, in whom ye trust.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?</span> </div><ul class='tnav'>
