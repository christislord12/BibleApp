<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 7</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span> After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> Now the Jews’ feast of tabernacles was at hand.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judæa, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> For <span class='add'>there is</span> no man <span class='add'>that</span> doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> For neither did his brethren believe in him.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> Then Jesus said unto them, <span class='wj'> My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> When he had said these words unto them, he abode <span class='add'>still</span> in Galilee. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>¶ But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>¶ Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> Jesus answered them, and said, <span class='wj'> My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or <span class='add'>whether</span> I speak of myself.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Did not Moses give you the law, and <span class='add'>yet</span> none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> Jesus answered and said unto them, <span class='wj'> I have done one work, and ye all marvel.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, <span class='wj'> Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this <span class='add'>man</span> hath done? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>¶ The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> Then said Jesus unto them, <span class='wj'> Yet a little while am I with you, and <span class='add'>then</span> I go unto him that sent me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Ye shall seek me, and shall not find <span class='add'>me</span>: and where I am, <span class='add'>thither</span> ye cannot come.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span> What <span class='add'>manner of</span> saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find <span class='add'>me</span>: and where I am, <span class='add'>thither</span> ye cannot come?  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span> In the last day, that great <span class='add'>day</span> of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, <span class='wj'> If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet <span class='add'>given</span>; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>¶ Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span> Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span> Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span> So there was a division among the people because of him.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span> And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>¶ Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span> The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span> Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span> Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span> But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span> Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Doth our law judge <span class='add'>any</span> man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span> They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span> And every man went unto his own house. </div><ul class='tnav'>
