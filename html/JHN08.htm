<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 8</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span> Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with <span class='add'>his</span> finger wrote on the ground, <span class='add'> as though he heard them not</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, <span class='wj'> He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> And they which heard <span class='add'>it</span>, being convicted by <span class='add'>their own</span> conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, <span class='add'>even</span> unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, <span class='wj'> Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, <span class='wj'> Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>¶ Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, <span class='wj'> I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> Jesus answered and said unto them, <span class='wj'> Though I bear record of myself, <span class='add'>yet</span> my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, <span class='wj'> Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> Then said Jesus again unto them, <span class='wj'> I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> And he said unto them, <span class='wj'> Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am <span class='add'>he</span>, ye shall die in your sins.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, <span class='wj'> Even <span class='add'>the same</span> that I said unto you from the beginning.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> Then said Jesus unto them, <span class='wj'> When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am <span class='add'>he</span>, and <span class='add'>that</span> I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> As he spake these words, many believed on him.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, <span class='wj'> If ye continue in my word, <span class='add'>then</span> are ye my disciples indeed;</span>  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>¶ They answered him, We be Abraham’s seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> Jesus answered them, <span class='wj'> Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: <span class='add'>but</span> the Son abideth ever.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span> They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, <span class='wj'> If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Ye do the deeds of your father.</span> Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, <span class='add'>even</span> God.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span> Jesus said unto them, <span class='wj'> If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Why do ye not understand my speech? <span class='add'>even</span> because ye cannot hear my word.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Ye are of <span class='add'>your</span> father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And because I tell <span class='add'>you</span> the truth, ye believe me not.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> He that is of God heareth God’s words: ye therefore hear <span class='add'>them</span> not, because ye are not of God.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span> Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span> Jesus answered, <span class='wj'> I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span> Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span> Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span> Jesus answered, <span class='wj'> If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw <span class='add'>it</span>, and was glad.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span> Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span> Jesus said unto them, <span class='wj'> Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span> Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by. </div><ul class='tnav'>
