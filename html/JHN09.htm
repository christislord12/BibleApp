<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 9</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span> And as <span class='add'>Jesus</span> passed by, he saw a man which was blind from <span class='add'>his</span> birth.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> Jesus answered, <span class='wj'> Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> And said unto him, <span class='wj'> Go, wash in the pool of Siloam,</span> (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>¶ The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> Some said, This is he: others <span class='add'>said</span>, He is like him: <span class='add'>but</span> he said, I am <span class='add'>he</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>¶ They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> These <span class='add'>words</span> spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner <span class='add'>or no</span>, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear <span class='add'>it</span> again? will ye also be his disciples?  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses’ disciples.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> We know that God spake unto Moses: <span class='add'>as for</span> this <span class='add'>fellow</span>, we know not from whence he is.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and <span class='add'>yet</span> he hath opened mine eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, <span class='wj'> Dost thou believe on the Son of God?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span> He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span> And Jesus said unto him, <span class='wj'> Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span> And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>¶ And Jesus said, <span class='wj'> For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span> And <span class='add'>some</span> of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span> Jesus said unto them, <span class='wj'> If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.</span> </div><ul class='tnav'>
