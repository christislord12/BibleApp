Can a devil open the eyes of the blind? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>¶ And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon’s porch.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> Jesus answered them, <span class='wj'> I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father’s name, they bear witness of me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any <span class='add'>man</span> pluck them out of my hand.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> My Father, which gave <span class='add'>them</span> me, is greater than all; and no <span class='add'>man</span> is able to pluck <span class='add'>them</span> out of my Father’s hand.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> I and <span class='add'>my</span> Father are one.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> Jesus answered them, <span class='wj'> Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> Jesus answered them, <span class='wj'> Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;</span>  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father <span class='add'>is</span> in me, and I in him.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span> Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span> And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span> And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span> And many believed on him there. </div><ul class='tnav'>
