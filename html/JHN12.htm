Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Father, glorify thy name.</span> Then came there a voice from heaven, <span class='add'>saying</span>, I have both glorified <span class='add'>it</span>, and will glorify <span class='add'>it</span> again.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> The people therefore, that stood by, and heard <span class='add'>it</span>, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> Jesus answered and said, <span class='wj'> This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all <span class='add'>men</span> unto me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> This he said, signifying what death he should die.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> Then Jesus said unto them, <span class='wj'> Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light.</span> These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>¶ But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span> That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span> Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span> He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with <span class='add'>their</span> eyes, nor understand with <span class='add'>their</span> heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span> These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>¶ Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess <span class='add'>him</span>, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span> For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>¶ Jesus cried and said, <span class='wj'> He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.</span> </div><ul class='tnav'>
