As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> I am the vine, ye <span class='add'>are</span> the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast <span class='add'>them</span> into the fire, and they are burned.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and <span class='add'>that</span> your joy might be full.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and <span class='add'>that</span> your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> These things I command you, that ye love one another.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before <span class='add'>it hated</span> you.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But all these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake, because they know not him that sent me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloke for their sin.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> He that hateth me hateth my Father also.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But <span class='add'>this cometh to pass</span>, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, <span class='add'>even</span> the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.</span> </div><ul class='tnav'>
