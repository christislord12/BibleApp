And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Of sin, because they believe not on me;</span>  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;</span>  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, <span class='add'>that</span> shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew <span class='add'>it</span> unto you.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew <span class='add'>it</span> unto you.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> Then said <span class='add'>some</span> of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, <span class='wj'> Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give <span class='add'>it</span> you.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> Jesus answered them, <span class='wj'> Do ye now believe?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.</span> </div><ul class='tnav'>
