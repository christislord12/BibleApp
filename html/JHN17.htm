Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we <span class='add'>are</span>.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;</span>  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> That they all may be one; as thou, Father, <span class='add'>art</span> in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare <span class='add'>it</span>: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.</span> </div><ul class='tnav'>
