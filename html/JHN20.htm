She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> Jesus saith unto her, <span class='wj'> Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou?</span> She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> Jesus saith unto her, <span class='wj'> Mary.</span> She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> Jesus saith unto her, <span class='wj'> Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and <span class='add'>to</span> my God, and your God.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and <span class='add'>that</span> he had spoken these things unto her. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>¶ Then the same day at evening, being the first <span class='add'>day</span> of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, <span class='wj'> Peace <span class='add'>be</span> unto you.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> And when he had so said, he shewed unto them <span class='add'>his</span> hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> Then said Jesus to them again, <span class='wj'> Peace <span class='add'>be</span> unto you: as <span class='add'>my</span> Father hath sent me, even so send I you.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> And when he had said this, he breathed on <span class='add'>them</span>, and saith unto them, <span class='wj'> Receive ye the Holy Ghost:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; <span class='add'>and</span> whose soever <span class='add'>sins</span> ye retain, they are retained.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>¶ But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>¶ And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: <span class='add'>then</span> came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, <span class='wj'> Peace <span class='add'>be</span> unto you.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> Then saith he to Thomas, <span class='wj'> Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust <span class='add'>it</span> into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> Jesus saith unto him, <span class='wj'> Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed <span class='add'>are</span> they that have not seen, and <span class='add'>yet</span> have believed.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>¶ And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name. </div><ul class='tnav'>
