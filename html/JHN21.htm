<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 21</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span> After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he <span class='add'>himself</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the <span class='add'>sons</span> of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> Then Jesus saith unto them, <span class='wj'> Children, have ye any meat?</span> They answered him, No.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> And he said unto them, <span class='wj'> Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find.</span> They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt <span class='add'>his</span> fisher’s coat <span class='add'>unto him</span>, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> Jesus saith unto them, <span class='wj'> Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> Jesus saith unto them, <span class='wj'> Come <span class='add'>and</span> dine.</span> And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>¶ So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, <span class='wj'> Simon, <span class='add'>son</span> of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these?</span> He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, <span class='wj'> Feed my lambs.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> He saith to him again the second time, <span class='wj'> Simon, <span class='add'>son</span> of Jonas, lovest thou me?</span> He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, <span class='wj'> Feed my sheep.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> He saith unto him the third time, <span class='wj'> Simon, <span class='add'>son</span> of Jonas, lovest thou me?</span> Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, <span class='wj'> Feed my sheep.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry <span class='add'>thee</span> whither thou wouldest not.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, <span class='wj'> Follow me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what <span class='add'>shall</span> this man <span class='add'>do</span>?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> Jesus saith unto him, <span class='wj'> If I will that he tarry till I come, what <span class='add'>is that</span> to thee? follow thou me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what <span class='add'>is that</span> to thee?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen. </div><ul class='tnav'>
