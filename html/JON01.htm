But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil <span class='add'>is</span> upon us.
