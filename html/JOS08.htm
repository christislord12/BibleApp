And Joshua stretched out the spear that <span class='add'>he had</span> in his hand toward the city.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> power: Heb. hand</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>so</span> it was, <span class='add'>that</span> all that fell that day, both of men and women, <span class='add'>were</span> twelve thousand, <span class='add'>even</span> all the men of Ai.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> which he commanded Joshua.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, <span class='add'>even</span> a desolation unto this day.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones, <span class='add'>that remaineth</span> unto this day. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>¶ Then Joshua built an altar unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God of Israel in mount Ebal,  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> As Moses the servant of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up <span class='add'>any</span> iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and sacrificed peace offerings. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>¶ And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> were…: Heb. walked</span></a> </div><ul class='tnav'>
