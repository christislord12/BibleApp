And Joshua said unto them, Who <span class='add'>are</span> ye? and from whence come ye?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that <span class='add'>were</span> beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, which <span class='add'>was</span> at Ashtaroth.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We <span class='add'>are</span> your servants: therefore now make ye a league with us.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> with you: Heb. in your hand</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> This our bread we took hot <span class='add'>for</span> our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is mouldy:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> And these bottles of wine, which we filled, <span class='add'>were</span> new; and, behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And the men took of their victuals, and asked not <span class='add'>counsel</span> at the mouth of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> the men…: or, they received the men by reason of their victuals</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>¶ And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they <span class='add'>were</span> their neighbours, and <span class='add'>that</span> they dwelt among them.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities <span class='add'>were</span> Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjath-jearim.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God of Israel.
