And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, <span class='add'>that</span> Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the cave’s mouth, <span class='add'>which remain</span> until this very day. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>¶ And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that <span class='add'>were</span> therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah:  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> delivered  it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that <span class='add'>were</span> therein; he let none remain in it; but did unto the king thereof as he did unto the king of Jericho. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>¶ And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> delivered  Lachish into the hand of Israel, which took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that <span class='add'>were</span> therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>¶ Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>¶ And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it:  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that <span class='add'>were</span> therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span> And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it:  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span> And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that <span class='add'>were</span> therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that <span class='add'>were</span> therein. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>¶ And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it:  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span> And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that <span class='add'>were</span> therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to her king. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>¶ So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God of Israel commanded.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span> And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span> And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God of Israel fought for Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span> And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal. </div><ul class='tnav'>
