for the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> your God <span class='add'>is</span> he that hath fought for you.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great sea westward.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> westward: Heb. at the sunset</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> your God, he shall expel them from before you, and drive them from out of your sight;
