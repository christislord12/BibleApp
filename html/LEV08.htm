 <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> And gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> And Moses did as the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> commanded him; and the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> And Moses said unto the congregation, This <span class='add'>is</span> the thing which the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> commanded to be done.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound <span class='add'>it</span> unto him therewith.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, <span class='add'>even</span> upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that <span class='add'>was</span> therein, and sanctified them.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify them.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron’s head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> And Moses brought Aaron’s sons, and put coats upon them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them;
