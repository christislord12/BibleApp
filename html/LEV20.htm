he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>¶ And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>¶ Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I <span class='add'>am</span> the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> your God.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I <span class='add'>am</span> the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> which sanctify you. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>¶ For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother;
