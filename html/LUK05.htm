<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 5</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span> And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing <span class='add'>their</span> nets.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon’s, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, <span class='wj'> Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> And they beckoned unto <span class='add'>their</span> partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> When Simon Peter saw <span class='add'>it</span>, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> And so <span class='add'>was</span> also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, <span class='wj'> Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>¶ And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on <span class='add'>his</span> face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> And he put forth <span class='add'>his</span> hand, and touched him, saying, <span class='wj'> I will: be thou clean.</span> And immediately the leprosy departed from him.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And he charged him to tell no man: <span class='wj'> but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>¶ And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judæa, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was <span class='add'>present</span> to heal them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>¶ And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought <span class='add'>means</span> to bring him in, and to lay <span class='add'>him</span> before him.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> And when they could not find by what <span class='add'>way</span> they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with <span class='add'>his</span> couch into the midst before Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, <span class='wj'> Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, <span class='wj'> What reason ye in your hearts?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins,</span> (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) <span class='wj'> I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>¶ And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, <span class='wj'> Follow me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> And he left all, rose up, and followed him.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> And Jesus answering said unto them, <span class='wj'> They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>¶ And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise <span class='add'>the disciples</span> of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> And he said unto them, <span class='wj'> Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>¶ And he spake also a parable unto them; <span class='wj'> No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was <span class='add'>taken</span> out of the new agreeth not with the old.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> No man also having drunk old <span class='add'>wine</span> straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is better.</span> </div><ul class='tnav'>
