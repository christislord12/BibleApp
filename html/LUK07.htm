<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 7</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span> Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth <span class='add'>it</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, <span class='wj'> I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>¶ And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, <span class='wj'> Weep not.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare <span class='add'>him</span> stood still. And he said, <span class='wj'> Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judæa, and throughout all the region round about.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>¶ And John calling <span class='add'>unto him</span> two of his disciples sent <span class='add'>them</span> to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> And in that same hour he cured many of <span class='add'>their</span> infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many <span class='add'>that were</span> blind he gave sight.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> Then Jesus answering said unto them, <span class='wj'> Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And blessed is <span class='add'>he</span>, whosoever shall not be offended in me.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>¶ And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, <span class='wj'> What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings’ courts.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> This is <span class='add'>he</span>, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> And all the people that heard <span class='add'>him</span>, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>¶ And the Lord said, <span class='wj'> Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!</span>  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But wisdom is justified of all her children.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>¶ And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to meat.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span> And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that <span class='add'>Jesus</span> sat at meat in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span> And stood at his feet behind <span class='add'>him</span> weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe <span class='add'>them</span> with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed <span class='add'>them</span> with the ointment.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span> Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw <span class='add'>it</span>, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman <span class='add'>this is</span> that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span> And Jesus answering said unto him, <span class='wj'> Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee.</span> And he saith, Master, say on.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span> Simon answered and said, I suppose that <span class='add'>he</span>, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, <span class='wj'> Thou hast rightly judged.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span> And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, <span class='wj'> Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped <span class='add'>them</span> with the hairs of her head.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, <span class='add'>the same</span> loveth little.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span> And he said unto her, <span class='wj'> Thy sins are forgiven.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span> And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span> And he said to the woman, <span class='wj'> Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.</span> </div><ul class='tnav'>
