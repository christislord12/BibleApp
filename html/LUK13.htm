And he said unto them, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>¶ <span class='wj'> Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all <span class='add'>ye</span> workers of iniquity.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you <span class='add'>yourselves</span> thrust out.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And they shall come from the east, and <span class='add'>from</span> the west, and from the north, and <span class='add'>from</span> the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>¶ The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto him, Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> And he said unto them, <span class='wj'> Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third <span class='add'>day</span> I shall be perfected.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the <span class='add'>day</span> following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen <span class='add'>doth gather</span> her brood under <span class='add'>her</span> wings, and ye would not!</span>  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until <span class='add'>the time</span> come when ye shall say, Blessed <span class='add'>is</span> he that cometh in the name of the Lord.</span> </div><ul class='tnav'>
