And he divided unto them <span class='add'>his</span> living. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father’s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!</span>  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,</span>  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put <span class='add'>it</span> on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on <span class='add'>his</span> feet:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill <span class='add'>it</span>; and let us eat, and be merry:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And he answering said to <span class='add'>his</span> father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.</span> </div><ul class='tnav'>
