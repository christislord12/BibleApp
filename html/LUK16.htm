<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 16</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span> And he said also unto his disciples, <span class='wj'> There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> So he called every one of his lord’s debtors <span class='add'>unto him</span>, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true <span class='add'>riches</span>?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man’s, who shall give you that which is your own?</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>¶ No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> And he said unto them, <span class='wj'> Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> The law and the prophets <span class='add'>were</span> until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from <span class='add'>her</span> husband committeth adultery.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>¶ There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,</span>  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man’s table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham’s bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;</span>  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that <span class='add'>would come</span> from thence.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father’s house:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.</span> </div><ul class='tnav'>
