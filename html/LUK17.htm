I trow not.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>¶ And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> And they lifted up <span class='add'>their</span> voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And when he saw <span class='add'>them</span>, he said unto them, <span class='wj'> Go shew yourselves unto the priests.</span> And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> And fell down on <span class='add'>his</span> face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> And Jesus answering said, <span class='wj'> Were there not ten cleansed? but where <span class='add'>are</span> the nine?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> And he said unto him, <span class='wj'> Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>¶ And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, <span class='wj'> The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> And he said unto the disciples, <span class='wj'> The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see <span class='add'>it</span>.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after <span class='add'>them</span>, nor follow <span class='add'>them</span>.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one <span class='add'>part</span> under heaven, shineth unto the other <span class='add'>part</span> under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;</span>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed <span class='add'>them</span> all.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Remember Lot’s wife.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> I tell you, in that night there shall be two <span class='add'>men</span> in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Two <span class='add'>women</span> shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Two <span class='add'>men</span> shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span> And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them, <span class='wj'> Wheresoever the body <span class='add'>is</span>, thither will the eagles be gathered together.</span> </div><ul class='tnav'>
