<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 18</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span> And he spake a parable unto them <span class='add'>to this end</span>, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> Saying, <span class='wj'> There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;</span>  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> And the Lord said, <span class='wj'> Hear what the unjust judge saith.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men <span class='add'>are</span>, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as <span class='add'>his</span> eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> I tell you, this man went down to his house justified <span class='add'>rather</span> than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when <span class='add'>his</span> disciples saw <span class='add'>it</span>, they rebuked them.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> But Jesus called them <span class='add'>unto him</span>, and said, <span class='wj'> Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> And Jesus said unto him, <span class='wj'> Why callest thou me good? none <span class='add'>is</span> good, save one, <span class='add'>that is</span>, God.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, <span class='wj'> Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, <span class='wj'> How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!</span>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> And they that heard <span class='add'>it</span> said, Who then can be saved?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> And he said, <span class='wj'> The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> And he said unto them, <span class='wj'> Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God’s sake,</span>  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>¶ Then he took <span class='add'>unto him</span> the twelve, and said unto them, <span class='wj'> Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And they shall scourge <span class='add'>him</span>, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>¶ And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span> And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span> And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span> And he cried, saying, Jesus, <span class='add'>thou</span> Son of David, have mercy on me.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span> And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, <span class='add'>Thou</span> Son of David, have mercy on me.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span> And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span> Saying, <span class='wj'> What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee?</span> And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span> And Jesus said unto him, <span class='wj'> Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span> And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw <span class='add'>it</span>, gave praise unto God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
