Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give <span class='add'>it</span> to him that hath ten pounds.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>(And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)</span>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay <span class='add'>them</span> before me.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>¶ And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called <span class='add'>the mount</span> of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> Saying, <span class='wj'> Go ye into the village over against <span class='add'>you</span>; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring <span class='add'>him hither</span>.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose <span class='add'>him</span>? thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> And they said, The Lord hath need of him.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span> And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span> And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span> Saying, Blessed <span class='add'>be</span> the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span> And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span> And he answered and said unto them, <span class='wj'> I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>¶ And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span> Saying, <span class='wj'> If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things <span class='add'>which belong</span> unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,</span>  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span> And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought;  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span> Saying unto them, <span class='wj'> It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span> And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span> And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
