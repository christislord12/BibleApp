<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 23</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span> And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this <span class='add'>fellow</span> perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Cæsar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, <span class='wj'> Thou sayest <span class='add'>it</span>.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> Then said Pilate to the chief priests and <span class='add'>to</span> the people, I find no fault in this man.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilæan.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>¶ And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long <span class='add'>season</span>, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked <span class='add'>him</span>, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>¶ And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>¶ And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined <span class='add'>him</span> before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> I will therefore chastise him, and release <span class='add'>him</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this <span class='add'>man</span>, and release unto us Barabbas:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> But they cried, saying, Crucify <span class='add'>him</span>, crucify him.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let <span class='add'>him</span> go.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear <span class='add'>it</span> after Jesus. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>¶ And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> But Jesus turning unto them said, <span class='wj'> Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed <span class='add'>are</span> the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>¶ Then said Jesus, <span class='wj'> Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.</span> And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided <span class='add'>him</span>, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span> And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span> And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span> And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>¶ And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span> But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span> And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span> And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span> And Jesus said unto him, <span class='wj'> Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span> And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span> And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>¶ And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, <span class='wj'> Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit:</span> and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span> Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span> And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span> And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>¶ And, behold, <span class='add'>there was</span> a man named Joseph, a counsellor; <span class='add'>and he was</span> a good man, and a just:  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) <span class='add'>he was</span> of Arimathæa, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span> This <span class='add'>man</span> went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span> And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span> And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span> And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span> And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment. </div><ul class='tnav'>
