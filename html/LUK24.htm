And he went in to tarry with them.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed <span class='add'>it</span>, and brake, and gave to them.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> And they told what things <span class='add'>were done</span> in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>¶ And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, <span class='wj'> Peace <span class='add'>be</span> unto you.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span> But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span> And he said unto them, <span class='wj'> Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span> And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them <span class='add'>his</span> hands and <span class='add'>his</span> feet.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span> And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, <span class='wj'> Have ye here any meat?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span> And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span> And he took <span class='add'>it</span>, and did eat before them.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span> And he said unto them, <span class='wj'> These <span class='add'>are</span> the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and <span class='add'>in</span> the prophets, and <span class='add'>in</span> the psalms, concerning me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span> Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span> And said unto them, <span class='wj'> Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And ye are witnesses of these things.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>¶ And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>¶ And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span> And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span> And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span> And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God.
