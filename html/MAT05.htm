lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>¶ Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast <span class='add'>it</span> from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not <span class='add'>that</span> thy whole body should be cast into hell.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast <span class='add'>it</span> from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not <span class='add'>that</span> thy whole body should be cast into hell.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>¶ Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God’s throne:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>¶ Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have <span class='add'>thy</span> cloke also.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>¶ Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;</span>  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more <span class='add'>than others</span>? do not even the publicans so?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.</span> </div><ul class='tnav'>
