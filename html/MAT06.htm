Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>¶ And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites <span class='add'>are</span>: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen <span class='add'>do</span>: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as <span class='add'>it is</span> in heaven.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Give us this day our daily bread.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>¶ Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;</span>  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>¶ Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great <span class='add'>is</span> that darkness!</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>¶ No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, <span class='add'>shall he</span> not much more <span class='add'>clothe</span> you, O ye of little faith?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day <span class='add'>is</span> the evil thereof.</span> </div><ul class='tnav'>
