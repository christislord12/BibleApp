And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> And he said unto them, <span class='wj'> What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift <span class='add'>it</span> out?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> Then saith he to the man, <span class='wj'> Stretch forth thine hand.</span> And he stretched <span class='add'>it</span> forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>¶ Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> But when Jesus knew <span class='add'>it</span>, he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> And charged them that they should not make him known:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> And in his name shall the Gentiles trust. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>¶ Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> But when the Pharisees heard <span class='add'>it</span>, they said, This <span class='add'>fellow</span> doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, <span class='wj'> Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast <span class='add'>them</span> out? therefore they shall be your judges.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Or else how can one enter into a strong man’s house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>¶ Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy <span class='add'>against</span> the <span class='add'>Holy</span> Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And whosoever  speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever  speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the <span class='add'>world</span> to come.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by <span class='add'>his</span> fruit.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>¶ Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span> But he answered and said unto them, <span class='wj'> An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale’s belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas <span class='add'>is</span> here.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon <span class='add'>is</span> here.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth <span class='add'>it</span> empty, swept, and garnished.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last <span class='add'>state</span> of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>¶ While he yet talked to the people, behold, <span class='add'>his</span> mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span> Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span> But he answered and said unto him that told him, <span class='wj'> Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span> And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, <span class='wj'> Behold my mother and my brethren!</span>  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For whosoever  shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.</span> </div><ul class='tnav'>
