This is he which received seed by the way side.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;</span>  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth <span class='add'>it</span>; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>¶ Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, <span class='wj'> The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>¶ Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, <span class='wj'> The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>¶ Another parable spake he unto them; <span class='wj'> The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span> Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span> He answered and said unto them, <span class='wj'> He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;</span>  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked <span class='add'>one</span>;</span>  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;</span>  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>¶ Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>¶ Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>¶ Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,</span>  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span> Jesus saith unto them, <span class='wj'> Have ye understood all these things?</span> They say unto him, Yea, Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span> Then said he unto them, <span class='wj'> Therefore every scribe <span class='add'>which is</span> instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man <span class='add'>that is</span> an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure <span class='add'>things</span> new and old.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>¶ And it came to pass, <span class='add'>that</span> when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span> And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this <span class='add'>man</span> this wisdom, and <span class='add'>these</span> mighty works?  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span> Is not this the carpenter’s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span> And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this <span class='add'>man</span> all these things?  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span> And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, <span class='wj'> A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span> And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief. </div><ul class='tnav'>
