Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> <span class='add'>Ye</span> hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,</span>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with <span class='add'>their</span> lips; but their heart is far from me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But in vain they do worship me, teaching <span class='add'>for</span> doctrines the commandments of men.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>¶ And he called the multitude, and said unto them, <span class='wj'> Hear, and understand:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> But he answered and said, <span class='wj'> Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> And Jesus said, <span class='wj'> Are ye also yet without understanding?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> These are <span class='add'>the things</span> which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>¶ Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, <span class='add'>thou</span> Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> But he answered and said, <span class='wj'> I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> But he answered and said, <span class='wj'> It is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast <span class='add'>it</span> to dogs.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> Then Jesus answered and said unto her, <span class='wj'> O woman, great <span class='add'>is</span> thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt.</span> And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> And great multitudes came unto him, having with them <span class='add'>those that were</span> lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus’ feet; and he healed them:  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>¶ Then Jesus called his disciples <span class='add'>unto him</span>, and said, <span class='wj'> I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> And Jesus saith unto them, <span class='wj'> How many loaves have ye?</span> And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span> And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake <span class='add'>them</span>, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span> And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken <span class='add'>meat</span> that was left seven baskets full.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span> And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span> And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala. </div><ul class='tnav'>
