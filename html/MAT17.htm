Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>¶ And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a <span class='add'>certain</span> man, kneeling down to him, and saying,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> Then Jesus answered and said, <span class='wj'> O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> And Jesus said unto them, <span class='wj'> Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>¶ And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, <span class='wj'> The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again.</span> And they were exceeding sorry. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>¶ And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute <span class='add'>money</span> came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, <span class='wj'> What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, <span class='wj'> Then are the children free.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.</span> </div><ul class='tnav'>
