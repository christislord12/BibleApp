go ye out to meet him.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But the wise answered, saying, <span class='add'>Not so</span>; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>¶ For <span class='add'>the kingdom of heaven is</span> as a man travelling into a far country, <span class='add'>who</span> called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made <span class='add'>them</span> other five talents.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And likewise he that <span class='add'>had received</span> two, he also gained other two.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord’s money.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> His lord said unto him, Well done, <span class='add'>thou</span> good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, <span class='add'>there</span> thou hast <span class='add'>that is</span> thine.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> His lord answered and said unto him, <span class='add'>Thou</span> wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and <span class='add'>then</span> at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Take therefore the talent from him, and give <span class='add'>it</span> unto him which hath ten talents.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>¶ When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth <span class='add'>his</span> sheep from the goats:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed <span class='add'>thee</span>? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed <span class='add'>thee</span>?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done <span class='add'>it</span> unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done <span class='add'>it</span> unto me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did <span class='add'>it</span> not to one of the least of these, ye did <span class='add'>it</span> not to me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.</span> </div><ul class='tnav'>
