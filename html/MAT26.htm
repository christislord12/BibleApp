And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>¶ Now the first <span class='add'>day</span> of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> And he said, <span class='wj'> Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> And as they did eat, he said, <span class='wj'> Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> And he answered and said, <span class='wj'> He that dippeth <span class='add'>his</span> hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, <span class='wj'> Thou hast said.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>¶ And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed <span class='add'>it</span>, and brake <span class='add'>it</span>, and gave <span class='add'>it</span> to the disciples, and said, <span class='wj'> Take, eat; this is my body.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave <span class='add'>it</span> to them, saying, <span class='wj'> Drink ye all of it;</span>  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> Then saith Jesus unto them, <span class='wj'> All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> Peter answered and said unto him, Though all <span class='add'>men</span> shall be offended because of thee, <span class='add'>yet</span> will I never be offended.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> Jesus said unto him, <span class='wj'> Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>¶ Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, <span class='wj'> Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span> And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span> Then saith he unto them, <span class='wj'> My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span> And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, <span class='wj'> O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou <span class='add'>wilt</span>.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span> And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, <span class='wj'> What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed <span class='add'>is</span> willing, but the flesh <span class='add'>is</span> weak.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span> He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, <span class='wj'> O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span> And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span> And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span> Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, <span class='wj'> Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>¶ And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span> Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span> And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span> And Jesus said unto him, <span class='wj'> Friend, wherefore art thou come?</span> Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span> And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out <span class='add'>his</span> hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest’s, and smote off his ear.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span> Then said Jesus unto him, <span class='wj'> Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span> In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, <span class='wj'> Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.</span> Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>¶ And they that had laid hold on Jesus led <span class='add'>him</span> away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span> But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest’s palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.  <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span> Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;  <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span> But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, <span class='add'>yet</span> found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,  <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span> And said, This <span class='add'>fellow</span> said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.  <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span> And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what <span class='add'>is it which</span> these witness against thee?  <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span> But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.  <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#160;</span> Jesus saith unto him, <span class='wj'> Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V65">65&#160;</span> Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.  <span class="verse" id="V66">66&#160;</span> What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.  <span class="verse" id="V67">67&#160;</span> Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,  <span class="verse" id="V68">68&#160;</span> Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V69">69&#160;</span>¶ Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.  <span class="verse" id="V70">70&#160;</span> But he denied before <span class='add'>them</span> all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.  <span class="verse" id="V71">71&#160;</span> And when he was gone out into the porch, another <span class='add'>maid</span> saw him, and said unto them that were there, This <span class='add'>fellow</span> was also with Jesus of Nazareth.  <span class="verse" id="V72">72&#160;</span> And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.  <span class="verse" id="V73">73&#160;</span> And after a while came unto <span class='add'>him</span> they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art <span class='add'>one</span> of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.  <span class="verse" id="V74">74&#160;</span> Then began he to curse and to swear, <span class='add'>saying</span>, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.  <span class="verse" id="V75">75&#160;</span> And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly. </div><ul class='tnav'>
