Come, see the place where the Lord lay.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>¶ And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, <span class='wj'> All hail.</span> And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> Then said Jesus unto them, <span class='wj'> Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>¶ Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him <span class='add'>away</span> while we slept.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And if this come to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>¶ Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, <span class='wj'> All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>¶ Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, <span class='add'>even</span> unto the end of the world.</span> Amen. </div><ul class='tnav'>
