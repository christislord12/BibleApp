that they might accuse him.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, <span class='wj'> Stand forth.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> And he saith unto them, <span class='wj'> Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill?</span> But they held their peace.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, <span class='wj'> Stretch forth thine hand.</span> And he stretched <span class='add'>it</span> out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judæa,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and <span class='add'>from</span> beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth <span class='add'>unto him</span> whom he would: and they came unto him.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> And Simon he surnamed Peter;  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> And James the <span class='add'>son</span> of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the <span class='add'>son</span> of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into an house.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> And when his friends heard <span class='add'>of it</span>, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>¶ And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> And he called them <span class='add'>unto him</span>, and said unto them in parables, <span class='wj'> How can Satan cast out Satan?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> No man can enter into a strong man’s house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>¶ There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> And he answered them, saying, <span class='wj'> Who is my mother, or my brethren?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, <span class='wj'> Behold my mother and my brethren!</span>  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.</span> </div><ul class='tnav'>
