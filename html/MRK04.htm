and how then will ye know all parables?</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>¶ The sower soweth the word.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;</span>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word’s sake, immediately they are offended.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,</span>  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive <span class='add'>it</span>, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>¶ And he said unto them, <span class='wj'> Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> And he said unto them, <span class='wj'> Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>¶ And he said, <span class='wj'> So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;</span>  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>¶ And he said, <span class='wj'> Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> <span class='add'>It is</span> like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear <span class='add'>it</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, <span class='wj'> Let us pass over unto the other side.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span> And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span> And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span> And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span> And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, <span class='wj'> Peace, be still.</span> And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span> And he said unto them, <span class='wj'> Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span> And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him? </div><ul class='tnav'>
