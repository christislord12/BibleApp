And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, <span class='add'>as</span> the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> He answered and said unto them, <span class='wj'> Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with <span class='add'>their</span> lips, but their heart is far from me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching <span class='add'>for</span> doctrines the commandments of men.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, <span class='add'>as</span> the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> And he said unto them, <span class='wj'> Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, <span class='add'>It is</span> Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; <span class='add'>he shall be free</span>.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;</span>  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>¶ And when he had called all the people <span class='add'>unto him</span>, he said unto them, <span class='wj'> Hearken unto me every one <span class='add'>of you</span>, and understand:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> And he saith unto them, <span class='wj'> Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, <span class='add'>it</span> cannot defile him;</span>  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> And he said, <span class='wj'> That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,</span>  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>¶ And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know <span class='add'>it</span>: but he could not be hid.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> For a <span class='add'>certain</span> woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> But Jesus said unto her, <span class='wj'> Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast <span class='add'>it</span> unto the dogs.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> And he said unto her, <span class='wj'> For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>¶ And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, <span class='wj'> Ephphatha,</span> that is, Be opened.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span> And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published <span class='add'>it</span>;  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span> And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak. </div><ul class='tnav'>
