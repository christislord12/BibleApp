 <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> And he asked them, <span class='wj'> How many loaves have ye?</span> And they said, Seven.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before <span class='add'>them</span>; and they did set <span class='add'>them</span> before the people.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before <span class='add'>them</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken <span class='add'>meat</span> that was left seven baskets.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>¶ And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, <span class='wj'> Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>¶ Now <span class='add'>the disciples</span> had forgotten to take bread, neither  had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> And he charged them, saying, <span class='wj'> Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and <span class='add'>of</span> the leaven of Herod.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> And they reasoned among themselves, saying, <span class='add'>It is</span> because we have no bread.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> And when Jesus knew <span class='add'>it</span>, he saith unto them, <span class='wj'> Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up?</span> They say unto him, Twelve.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up?</span> And they said, Seven.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> And he said unto them, <span class='wj'> How is it that ye do not understand?</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>¶ And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> After that he put <span class='add'>his</span> hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> And he sent him away to his house, saying, <span class='wj'> Neither go into the town, nor tell <span class='add'>it</span> to any in the town.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>¶ And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Cæsarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, <span class='wj'> Whom do men say that I am?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> And they answered, John the Baptist: but some <span class='add'>say</span>, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> And he saith unto them, <span class='wj'> But whom say ye that I am?</span> And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and <span class='add'>of</span> the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, <span class='wj'> Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>¶ And when he had called the people <span class='add'>unto him</span> with his disciples also, he said unto them, <span class='wj'> Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel’s, the same shall save it.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.</span> </div><ul class='tnav'>
