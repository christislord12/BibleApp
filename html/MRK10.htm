But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, <span class='wj'> Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!</span>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> And Jesus looking upon them saith, <span class='wj'> With men <span class='add'>it is</span> impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>¶ Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> And Jesus answered and said, <span class='wj'> Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel’s,</span>  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But many <span class='add'>that are</span> first shall be last; and the last first.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>¶ And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him,  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> <span class='add'>Saying</span>, <span class='wj'> Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>¶ And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span> And he said unto them, <span class='wj'> What would ye that I should do for you?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span> They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span> But Jesus said unto them, <span class='wj'> Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span> And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, <span class='wj'> Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but <span class='add'>it shall be given to them</span> for whom it is prepared.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span> And when the ten heard <span class='add'>it</span>, they began to be much displeased with James and John.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span> But Jesus called them <span class='add'>to him</span>, and saith unto them, <span class='wj'> Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>¶ And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimæus, the son of Timæus, sat by the highway side begging.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span> And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, <span class='add'>thou</span> Son of David, have mercy on me.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span> And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, <span class='add'>Thou</span> Son of David, have mercy on me.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span> And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span> And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span> And Jesus answered and said unto him, <span class='wj'> What wilt thou that I should do unto thee?</span> The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span> And Jesus said unto him, <span class='wj'> Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole.</span> And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way. </div><ul class='tnav'>
