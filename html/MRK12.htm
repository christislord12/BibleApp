But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, <span class='wj'> Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see <span class='add'>it</span>.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> And they brought <span class='add'>it</span>. And he saith unto them, <span class='wj'> Whose <span class='add'>is</span> this image and superscription?</span> And they said unto him, Cæsar’s.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> And Jesus answering said unto them, <span class='wj'> Render to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.</span> And they marvelled at him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>¶ Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man’s brother die, and leave <span class='add'>his</span> wife <span class='add'>behind him</span>, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> And Jesus answering said unto them, <span class='wj'> Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I <span class='add'>am</span> the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>¶ And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> And Jesus answered him, <span class='wj'> The first of all the commandments <span class='add'>is</span>, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this <span class='add'>is</span> the first commandment.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And the second <span class='add'>is</span> like, <span class='add'>namely</span> this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love <span class='add'>his</span> neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, <span class='wj'> Thou art not far from the kingdom of God.</span> And no man after that durst ask him <span class='add'>any question.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>¶ And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, <span class='wj'> How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The <span class='nd'>LORD</span> said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he <span class='add'>then</span> his son? And the common people heard him gladly.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>¶ And he said unto them in his doctrine, <span class='wj'> Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and <span class='add'>love</span> salutations in the marketplaces,</span>  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Which devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>¶ And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span> And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span> And he called <span class='add'>unto him</span> his disciples, and saith unto them, <span class='wj'> Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> For all <span class='add'>they</span> did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, <span class='add'>even</span> all her living.</span> </div><ul class='tnav'>
