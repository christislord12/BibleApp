And he answering said unto him, <span class='wj'> Thou sayest <span class='add'>it</span>.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> Now at <span class='add'>that</span> feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> And there was <span class='add'>one</span> named Barabbas, <span class='add'>which lay</span> bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And the multitude crying aloud began to desire <span class='add'>him to do</span> as he had ever done unto them.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do <span class='add'>unto him</span> whom ye call the King of the Jews?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> And they cried out again, Crucify him.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>¶ And <span class='add'>so</span> Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged <span class='add'>him</span>, to be crucified.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Prætorium; and they call together the whole band.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his <span class='add'>head</span>,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing <span class='add'>their</span> knees worshipped him.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received <span class='add'>it</span> not.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest <span class='add'>it</span> in three days,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> Save thyself, and come down from the cross.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, <span class='wj'> Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?</span> which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> And some of them that stood by, when they heard <span class='add'>it</span>, said, Behold, he calleth Elias.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span> And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put <span class='add'>it</span> on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span> And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span> And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>¶ And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span> There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>(Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>¶ And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span> Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span> And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling <span class='add'>unto him</span> the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span> And when he knew <span class='add'>it</span> of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span> And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span> And Mary Magdalene and Mary <span class='add'>the mother</span> of Joses beheld where he was laid. </div><ul class='tnav'>
