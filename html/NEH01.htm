And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and <span class='add'>certain</span> men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province <span class='add'>are</span> in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also <span class='add'>is</span> broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>¶ And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned <span class='add'>certain</span> days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> And said, I beseech thee, O <span class='nd'>LORD</span> God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father’s house have sinned.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, <span class='add'>If</span> ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But <span class='add'>if</span> ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, <span class='add'>yet</span> will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Now these <span class='add'>are</span> thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king’s cupbearer. </div><ul class='tnav'>
