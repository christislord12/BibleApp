And I set a great assembly against them.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> I consulted…: Heb. my heart consulted in me</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing <span class='add'>to answer</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> Also I said, It <span class='add'>is</span> not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I likewise, <span class='add'>and</span> my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth <span class='add'>part</span> of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> Then said they, We will restore <span class='add'>them</span>, and will require nothing of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>. And the people did according to this promise.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> emptied: Heb. empty, or, void</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>¶ Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, <span class='add'>that is</span>, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> But the former governors that <span class='add'>had been</span> before me were chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants <span class='add'>were</span> gathered thither unto the work.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Moreover <span class='add'>there were</span> at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that <span class='add'>are</span> about us.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Now <span class='add'>that</span> which was prepared <span class='add'>for me</span> daily <span class='add'>was</span> one ox <span class='add'>and</span> six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> Think upon me, my God, for good, <span class='add'>according</span> to all that I have done for this people. </div><ul class='tnav'>
