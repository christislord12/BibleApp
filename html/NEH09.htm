So didst thou get thee a name, as <span class='add'>it is</span> this day.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should go.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments:<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> true…: Heb. laws of truth</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> And gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> which…: Heb. which thou hadst lift up thine hand to give them</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and hearkened not to thy commandments,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but thou <span class='add'>art</span> a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest them not.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> a God…: Heb. a God of pardons</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This <span class='add'>is</span> thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations;  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed  not from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to shew them light, and the way wherein they should go.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, <span class='add'>so that</span> they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled  not.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess <span class='add'>it</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they would.<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> as they…: Heb. according to their will</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness.<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> wells: or, cisterns</span></a><a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§§<span class="popup"> fruit…: Heb. tree of food</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great provocations.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest <span class='add'>them</span> from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee: therefore leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest <span class='add'>them</span> from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies;<a href="#FN9" class="notemark">***<span class="popup"> they did…: Heb. they returned to do evil</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.<a href="#FN10" class="notemark">†††<span class="popup"> withdrew…: Heb. they gave a withdrawing shoulder</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands.<a href="#FN11" class="notemark">‡‡‡<span class="popup"> forbear…: Heb. protract over them</span></a><a href="#FN12" class="notemark">§§§<span class="popup"> in thy…: Heb. in the hand of thy prophets</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> Nevertheless for thy great mercies’ sake thou didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them;
