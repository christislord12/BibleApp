that they defile not their camps, in the midst whereof I dwell.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the camp: as the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> spake unto Moses, so did the children of Israel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>¶ And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> spake unto Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, and that person be guilty;  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> Then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and add unto it the fifth <span class='add'>part</span> thereof, and give <span class='add'>it</span> unto <span class='add'>him</span> against whom he hath trespassed.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto, let the trespass be recompensed unto the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, <span class='add'>even</span> to the priest;
