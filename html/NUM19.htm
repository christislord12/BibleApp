her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast <span class='add'>it</span> into the midst of the burning of the heifer.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> And a man <span class='add'>that is</span> clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay <span class='add'>them</span> up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation: it <span class='add'>is</span> a purification for sin.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>¶ He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> man: Heb. soul of man</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>;
