And Balak the son of Zippor <span class='add'>was</span> king of the Moabites at that time.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which <span class='add'>is</span> by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me:<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> face: Heb. eye</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they <span class='add'>are</span> too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, <span class='add'>that</span> we may smite them, and <span class='add'>that</span> I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest <span class='add'>is</span> blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men <span class='add'>are</span> these with thee?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, <span class='add'>saying</span>,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Behold, <span class='add'>there is</span> a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> I shall…: Heb. I shall prevail in fighting against him</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they <span class='add'>are</span> blessed.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> refuseth to give me leave to go with you.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>¶ And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Let…: Heb. Be not thou hindered from, etc</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> my God, to do less or more.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> will say unto me more.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call thee, rise up, <span class='add'>and</span> go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>¶ And God’s anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants <span class='add'>were</span> with him.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> And the ass saw the angel of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> But the angel of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall <span class='add'>being</span> on this side, and a wall on that side.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> And when the ass saw the angel of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall: and he smote her again.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> And the angel of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> went further, and stood in a narrow place, where <span class='add'>was</span> no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> And when the ass saw the angel of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam’s anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> And the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> And the ass said unto Balaam, <span class='add'>Am</span> not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since <span class='add'>I was</span> thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee?
