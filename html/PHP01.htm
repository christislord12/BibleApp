<div class='mt'>THE EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE PHILIPPIANS  
</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span> Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> Grace <span class='add'>be</span> unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and <span class='add'>from</span> the Lord Jesus Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform <span class='add'>it</span> until the day of Jesus Christ:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and <span class='add'>in</span> all judgment;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ;  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things <span class='add'>which happened</span> unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other <span class='add'>places</span>;  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> According to my earnest expectation and <span class='add'>my</span> hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but <span class='add'>that</span> with all boldness, as always, <span class='add'>so</span> now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether <span class='add'>it be</span> by life, or by death.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> For to me to live <span class='add'>is</span> Christ, and to die <span class='add'>is</span> gain.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> But if I live in the flesh, this <span class='add'>is</span> the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> Nevertheless to abide in the flesh <span class='add'>is</span> more needful for you.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear <span class='add'>to be</span> in me. </div><ul class='tnav'>
