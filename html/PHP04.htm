The Lord <span class='add'>is</span> at hand.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things <span class='add'>are</span> honest, whatsoever things <span class='add'>are</span> just, whatsoever things <span class='add'>are</span> pure, whatsoever things <span class='add'>are</span> lovely, whatsoever things <span class='add'>are</span> of good report; if <span class='add'>there be</span> any virtue, and if <span class='add'>there be</span> any praise, think on these things.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, <span class='add'>therewith</span> to be content.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things <span class='add'>which were sent</span> from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> Now unto God and our Father <span class='add'>be</span> glory for ever and ever. Amen. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> Salute every saint in Christ Jesus.
