or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;</span>  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and <span class='add'>I know</span> the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but <span class='add'>are</span> the synagogue of Satan.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast <span class='add'>some</span> of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;</span>  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, <span class='add'>even</span> where Satan’s seat <span class='add'>is</span>: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas <span class='add'>was</span> my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth <span class='add'>it.</span></span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet <span class='add'>are</span> like fine brass;</span>  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last <span class='add'>to be</span> more than the first.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> But that which ye have <span class='add'>already</span> hold fast till I come.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:</span>  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> And I will give him the morning star.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> <span class='wj'> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</span> </div><ul class='tnav'>
