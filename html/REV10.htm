And he said unto me, Take <span class='add'>it</span>, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> And I took the little book out of the angel’s hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings. </div><ul class='tnav'>
