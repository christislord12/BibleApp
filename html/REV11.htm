And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> The second woe is past; <span class='add'>and</span>, behold, the third woe cometh quickly.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become <span class='add'>the kingdoms</span> of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> Saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail. </div><ul class='tnav'>
