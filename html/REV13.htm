Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by <span class='add'>the means of</span> those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would  not worship the image of the beast should be killed.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number <span class='add'>is</span> Six hundred threescore <span class='add'>and</span> six. </div><ul class='tnav'>
