Blessed <span class='add'>is</span> he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, <span class='add'>and</span> so great.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, <span class='add'>every stone</span> about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great. </div><ul class='tnav'>
