And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What <span class='add'>city is</span> like unto this great city!  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> Rejoice over her, <span class='add'>thou</span> heaven, and <span class='add'>ye</span> holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast <span class='add'>it</span> into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft <span class='add'>he be</span>, shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth. </div><ul class='tnav'>
