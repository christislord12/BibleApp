This <span class='add'>is</span> the first resurrection.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> Blessed and holy <span class='add'>is</span> he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom <span class='add'>is</span> as the sand of the sea.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet <span class='add'>are</span>, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is <span class='add'>the book</span> of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire.
