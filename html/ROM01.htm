<div class='mt'>THE EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS  
</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span> Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called <span class='add'>to be</span> an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>(Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> And declared <span class='add'>to be</span> the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called <span class='add'>to be</span> saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed <span class='add'>it</span> unto them.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, <span class='add'>even</span> his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> Because that, when they knew God, they glorified <span class='add'>him</span> not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> And even as they did not like to retain God in <span class='add'>their</span> knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
