<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 3</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span> What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit <span class='add'>is there</span> of circumcision?  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? <span class='add'>Is</span> God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And not <span class='add'>rather</span>, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> What then? are we better <span class='add'>than they</span>? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> Their throat <span class='add'>is</span> an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps <span class='add'>is</span> under their lips:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> Whose mouth <span class='add'>is</span> full of cursing and bitterness:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> Their feet <span class='add'>are</span> swift to shed blood:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> Destruction and misery <span class='add'>are</span> in their ways:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> And the way of peace have they not known:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> There is no fear of God before their eyes. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law <span class='add'>is</span> the knowledge of sin. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> Even the righteousness of God <span class='add'>which is</span> by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> Whom God hath set forth <span class='add'>to be</span> a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> To declare, <span class='add'>I say</span>, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> Where <span class='add'>is</span> boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> <span class='add'>Is he</span> the God of the Jews only? <span class='add'>is he</span> not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> Seeing <span class='add'>it is</span> one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law. </div><ul class='tnav'>
