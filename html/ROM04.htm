<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 4</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span> What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath <span class='add'>whereof</span> to glory; but not before God.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> <span class='add'>Saying</span>, Blessed <span class='add'>are</span> they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> Blessed <span class='add'>is</span> the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> <span class='add'>Cometh</span> this blessedness then upon the circumcision <span class='add'>only</span>, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which <span class='add'>he had yet</span> being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which <span class='add'>he had</span> being <span class='add'>yet</span> uncircumcised.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, <span class='add'>was</span> not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> For if they which are of the law <span class='add'>be</span> heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, <span class='add'>there is</span> no transgression.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> Therefore <span class='add'>it is</span> of faith, that <span class='add'>it might be</span> by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, <span class='add'>even</span> God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations; according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara’s womb:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification. </div><ul class='tnav'>
