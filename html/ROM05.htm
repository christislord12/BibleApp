For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, <span class='add'>which is</span> by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> And not as <span class='add'>it was</span> by one that sinned, <span class='add'>so is</span> the gift: for the judgment <span class='add'>was</span> by one to condemnation, but the free gift <span class='add'>is</span> of many offences unto justification.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> Therefore as by the offence of one <span class='add'>judgment came</span> upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one <span class='add'>the free gift came</span> upon all men unto justification of life.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might  grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
