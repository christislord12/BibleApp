Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also <span class='add'>in the likeness</span> of <span class='add'>his</span> resurrection:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with <span class='add'>him</span>, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> For he that is dead is freed from sin.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> Neither yield ye your members <span class='add'>as</span> instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members <span class='add'>as</span> instruments of righteousness unto God.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things <span class='add'>is</span> death.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> For the wages of sin <span class='add'>is</span> death; but the gift of God <span class='add'>is</span> eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
