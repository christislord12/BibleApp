<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 7</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span> Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to <span class='add'>her</span> husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of <span class='add'>her</span> husband.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> So then if, while <span class='add'>her</span> husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, <span class='add'>even</span> to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not <span class='add'>in</span> the oldness of the letter. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> What shall we say then? <span class='add'>Is</span> the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin <span class='add'>was</span> dead.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> And the commandment, which <span class='add'>was ordained</span> to life, I found <span class='add'>to be</span> unto death.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew <span class='add'>me</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> Wherefore the law <span class='add'>is</span> holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that <span class='add'>it is</span> good.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but <span class='add'>how</span> to perform that which is good I find not.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin. </div><ul class='tnav'>
