<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 9</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span> I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> Who are Israelites; to whom <span class='add'>pertaineth</span> the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service <span class='add'>of God</span>, and the promises;  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> Whose <span class='add'>are</span> the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ <span class='add'>came</span>, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they <span class='add'>are</span> not all Israel, which are of Israel:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, <span class='add'>are they</span> all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these <span class='add'>are</span> not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> For this <span class='add'>is</span> the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sara shall have a son.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> And not only <span class='add'>this</span>; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, <span class='add'>even</span> by our father Isaac;  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>(For <span class='add'>the children</span> being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> What shall we say then? <span class='add'>Is there</span> unrighteousness with God? God forbid.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> So then <span class='add'>it is</span> not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will <span class='add'>have mercy</span>, and whom he will he hardeneth.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed <span class='add'>it</span>, Why hast thou made me thus?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> <span class='add'>What</span> if God, willing to shew <span class='add'>his</span> wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> And it shall come to pass, <span class='add'>that</span> in the place where it was said unto them, Ye <span class='add'>are</span> not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> For he will finish the work, and cut <span class='add'>it</span> short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> Wherefore? Because <span class='add'>they sought it</span> not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. </div><ul class='tnav'>
