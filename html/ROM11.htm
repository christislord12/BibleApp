<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 11</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span> I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, <span class='add'>of</span> the tribe of Benjamin.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to <span class='add'>the image of</span> Baal.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> And if by grace, then <span class='add'>is it</span> no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if <span class='add'>it be</span> of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>(According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but <span class='add'>rather</span> through their fall salvation <span class='add'>is come</span> unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> Now if the fall of them <span class='add'>be</span> the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> If by any means I may provoke to emulation <span class='add'>them which are</span> my flesh, and might save some of them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> For if the casting away of them <span class='add'>be</span> the reconciling of the world, what <span class='add'>shall</span> the receiving <span class='add'>of them be</span>, but life from the dead?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> For if the firstfruit <span class='add'>be</span> holy, the lump <span class='add'>is</span> also <span class='add'>holy</span>: and if the root <span class='add'>be</span> holy, so <span class='add'>are</span> the branches.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> For if God spared not the natural branches, <span class='add'>take heed</span> lest he also spare not thee.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in <span class='add'>his</span> goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural <span class='add'>branches</span>, be graffed into their own olive tree? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> For this <span class='add'>is</span> my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> As concerning the gospel, <span class='add'>they are</span> enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, <span class='add'>they are</span> beloved for the fathers’ sakes.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> For the gifts and calling of God <span class='add'>are</span> without repentance.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable <span class='add'>are</span> his judgments, and his ways past finding out!  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span> For of him, and through him, and to him, <span class='add'>are</span> all things: to whom <span class='add'>be</span> glory for ever.
