Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> <span class='add'>Be</span> kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> <span class='add'>Be</span> of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but <span class='add'>rather</span> give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance <span class='add'>is</span> mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good. </div><ul class='tnav'>
