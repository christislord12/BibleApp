For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to <span class='add'>execute</span> wrath upon him that doeth evil.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> Wherefore <span class='add'>ye</span> must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God’s ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute <span class='add'>is due</span>; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if <span class='add'>there be</span> any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love <span class='add'>is</span> the fulfilling of the law.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> And that, knowing the time, that now <span class='add'>it is</span> high time to awake out of sleep: for now <span class='add'>is</span> our salvation nearer than when we believed.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to <span class='add'>fulfil</span> the lusts <span class='add'>thereof.</span> </div><ul class='tnav'>
