Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day <span class='add'>alike</span>. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> He that regardeth the day, regardeth <span class='add'>it</span> unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard <span class='add'>it</span>. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord’s.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> For it is written, <span class='add'>As</span> I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in <span class='add'>his</span> brother’s way.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that <span class='add'>there is</span> nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him <span class='add'>it is</span> unclean.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> But if thy brother be grieved with <span class='add'>thy</span> meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> Let not then your good be evil spoken of:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> For he that in these things serveth Christ <span class='add'>is</span> acceptable to God, and approved of men.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed <span class='add'>are</span> pure; but <span class='add'>it is</span> evil for that man who eateth with offence.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> <span class='add'>It is</span> good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor <span class='add'>any thing</span> whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> Hast thou faith? have <span class='add'>it</span> to thyself before God. Happy <span class='add'>is</span> he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because <span class='add'>he eateth</span> not of faith: for whatsoever <span class='add'>is</span> not of faith is sin. </div><ul class='tnav'>
