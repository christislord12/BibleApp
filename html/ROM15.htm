For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ’s sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in <span class='add'>your</span> prayers to God for me;  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which <span class='add'>I have</span> for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> Now the God of peace <span class='add'>be</span> with you all.
