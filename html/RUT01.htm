And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> continued: Heb. were</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> And Elimelech Naomi’s husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one <span class='add'>was</span> Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>¶ Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> had visited his people in giving them bread.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother’s house: the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> The <span class='nd'>LORD</span> grant you that ye may find rest, each <span class='add'>of you</span> in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? <span class='add'>are</span> there yet <span class='add'>any more</span> sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> Turn again, my daughters, go <span class='add'>your way;</span> for I am too old to have an husband.
