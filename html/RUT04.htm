And he turned aside, and sat down.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which <span class='add'>was</span> our brother Elimelech’s:  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy <span class='add'>it</span> before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem <span class='add'>it</span>, redeem <span class='add'>it:</span> but if thou wilt not redeem <span class='add'>it, then</span> tell me, that I may know: for <span class='add'>there is</span> none to redeem <span class='add'>it</span> beside thee; and I <span class='add'>am</span> after thee. And he said, I will redeem <span class='add'>it</span>.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> I thought…: Heb.
