<div class='mt'>The Prayer of Azariah  
</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And they walked in the midst of the fire, praising God, and blessing the Lord. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Then Azarias stood up, and prayed on this manner; and opening his mouth in the midst of the fire said, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers: thy name is worthy to be praised and glorified for evermore: </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For thou art righteous in all the things that thou hast done to us: yea, true are all thy works, thy ways are right, and all thy judgments truth. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>In all the things that thou hast brought upon us, and upon the holy city of our fathers, even Jerusalem, thou hast executed true judgment: for according to truth and judgment didst thou bring all these things upon us because of our sins. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For we have sinned and committed iniquity, departing from thee. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>In all things have we trespassed, and not obeyed thy commandments, nor kept them, neither done as thou hast commanded us, that it might go well with us. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Wherefore all that thou hast brought upon us, and every thing that thou hast done to us, thou hast done in true judgment. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And thou didst deliver us into the hands of lawless enemies, most hateful forsakers of God, and to an unjust king, and the most wicked in all the world. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And now we cannot open our mouths, we are become a shame and reproach to thy servants; and to them that worship thee. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Yet deliver us not up wholly, for thy name’s sake, neither disannul thou thy covenant: </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And cause not thy mercy to depart from us, for thy beloved Abraham’s sake, for thy servant Issac’s sake, and for thy holy Israel’s sake; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>To whom thou hast spoken and promised, that thou wouldest multiply their seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that lieth upon the seashore. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For we, O Lord, are become less than any nation, and be kept under this day in all the world because of our sins. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Neither is there at this time prince, or prophet, or leader, or burnt offering, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, or place to sacrifice before thee, and to find mercy. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Nevertheless in a contrite heart and an humble spirit let us be accepted. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Like as in the burnt offerings of rams and bullocks, and like as in ten thousands of fat lambs: so let our sacrifice be in thy sight this day, and grant that we may wholly go after thee: for they shall not be confounded that put their trust in thee. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And now we follow thee with all our heart, we fear thee, and seek thy face. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Put us not to shame: but deal with us after thy lovingkindness, and according to the multitude of thy mercies. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Deliver us also according to thy marvellous works, and give glory to thy name, O Lord: and let all them that do thy servants hurt be ashamed; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And let them be confounded in all their power and might, and let their strength be broken; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And let them know that thou art God, the only God, and glorious over the whole world. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the king’s servants, that put them in, ceased not to make the oven hot with rosin, pitch, tow, and small wood; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>So that the flame streamed forth above the furnace forty and nine cubits. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And it passed through, and burned those Chaldeans it found about the furnace. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But the angel of the Lord came down into the oven together with Azarias and his fellows, and smote the flame of the fire out of the oven; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And made the midst of the furnace as it had been a moist whistling wind, so that the fire touched them not at all, neither hurt nor troubled them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then the three, as out of one mouth, praised, glorified, and blessed, God in the furnace, saying, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And blessed is thy glorious and holy name: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Blessed art thou in the temple of thine holy glory: and to be praised and glorified above all for ever. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Blessed art thou that beholdest the depths, and sittest upon the cherubims: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Blessed art thou on the glorious throne of thy kingdom: and to be praised and glorified above all for ever. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Blessed art thou in the firmament of heaven: and above all to be praised and glorified for ever. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>O all ye works of the Lord, bless ye the Lord: praise and exalt him above all for ever, </div><div class='p'>
