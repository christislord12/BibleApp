for so shalt thou escape wilful sin. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>As is the lust of an eunuch to deflower a virgin; so is he that executeth judgment with violence. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>There is one that keepeth silence, and is found wise: and another by much babbling becometh hateful. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Some man holdeth his tongue, because he hath not to answer: and some keepeth silence, knowing his time. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>A wise man will hold his tongue till he see opportunity: but a babbler and a fool will regard no time. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>He that useth many words shall be abhorred; and he that taketh to himself authority therein shall be hated. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>There is a sinner that hath good success in evil things; and there is a gain that turneth to loss. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>There is a gift that shall not profit thee; and there is a gift whose recompence is double. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>There is an abasement because of glory; and there is that lifteth up his head from a low estate. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>There is that buyeth much for a little, and repayeth it sevenfold. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>A wise man by his words maketh him beloved: but the graces of fools shall be poured out. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The gift of a fool shall do thee no good when thou hast it; neither yet of the envious for his necessity: for he looketh to receive many things for one. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He giveth little, and upbraideth much; he openeth his mouth like a crier; to day he lendeth, and to morrow will he ask it again: such an one is to be hated of God and man. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The fool saith, I have no friends, I have no thank for all my good deeds, and they that eat my bread speak evil of me. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>How oft, and of how many shall he be laughed to scorn! for he knoweth not aright what it is to have; and it is all one unto him as if he had it not. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>To slip upon a pavement is better than to slip with the tongue: so the fall of the wicked shall come speedily. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>An unseasonable tale will always be in the mouth of the unwise. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>A wise sentence shall be rejected when it cometh out of a fool’s mouth; for he will not speak it in due season. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>There is that is hindered from sinning through want: and when he taketh rest, he shall not be troubled. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>There is that destroyeth his own soul through bashfulness, and by accepting of persons overthroweth himself. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>There is that for bashfulness promiseth to his friend, and maketh him his enemy for nothing. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>A lie is a foul blot in a man, yet it is continually in the mouth of the untaught. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>A thief is better than a man that is accustomed to lie: but they both shall have destruction to heritage. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>The disposition of a liar is dishonourable, and his shame is ever with him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>A wise man shall promote himself to honour with his words: and he that hath understanding will please great men. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>He that tilleth his land shall increase his heap: and he that pleaseth great men shall get pardon for iniquity. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Presents and gifts blind the eyes of the wise, and stop up his mouth that he cannot reprove. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Wisdom that is hid, and treasure that is hoarded up, what profit is in them both? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Better is he that hideth his folly than a man that hideth his wisdom. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Necessary patience in seeking the Lord is better than he that leadeth his life without a guide. </div><ul class='tnav'>
