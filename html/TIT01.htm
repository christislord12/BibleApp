</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span> Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> To Titus, <span class='add'>mine</span> own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, <span class='add'>and</span> peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> One of themselves, <span class='add'>even</span> a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians <span class='add'>are</span> alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> Unto the pure all things <span class='add'>are</span> pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving <span class='add'>is</span> nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> They profess that they know God; but in works they deny <span class='add'>him</span>, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate. </div><ul class='tnav'>
