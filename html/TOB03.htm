Dost thou not know, said they, that thou hast strangled thine husbands? thou hast had already seven husbands, neither wast thou named after any of them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Wherefore dost thou beat us for them? if they be dead, go thy ways after them, let us never see of thee either son or daughter. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Whe she heard these things, she was very sorrowful, so that she thought to have strangled herself; and she said, I am the only daughter of my father, and if I do this, it shall be a reproach unto him, and I shall bring his old age with sorrow unto the grave. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then she prayed toward the window, and said, Blessed art thou, O Lord my God, and thine holy and glorious name is blessed and honourable for ever: let all thy works praise thee for ever. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And now, O Lord, I set mine eyes and my face toward thee, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And say, Take me out of the earth, that I may hear no more the reproach. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Thou knowest, Lord, that I am pure from all sin with man, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And that I never polluted my name, nor the name of my father, in the land of my captivity: I am the only daughter of my father, neither hath he any child to be his heir, neither any near kinsman, nor any son of his alive, to whom I may keep myself for a wife: my seven husbands are already dead; and why should I live? but if it please not thee that I should die, command some regard to be had of me, and pity taken of me, that I hear no more reproach. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So the prayers of them both were heard before the majesty of the great God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Raphael was sent to heal them both, that is, to scale away the whiteness of Tobit’s eyes, and to give Sara the daughter of Raguel for a wife to Tobias the son of Tobit; and to bind Asmodeus the evil spirit; because she belonged to Tobias by right of inheritance. The selfsame time came Tobit home, and entered into his house, and Sara the daughter of Raguel came down from her upper chamber. </div><ul class='tnav'>
