or who shall withstand thy judgment? or who shall accuse thee for the nations that perish, whom thou made? or who shall come to stand against thee, to be revenged for the unrighteous men? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For neither is there any God but thou that careth for all, to whom thou mightest shew that thy judgment is not unright. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Neither shall king or tyrant be able to set his face against thee for any whom thou hast punished. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Forsomuch then as thou art righteous thyself, thou orderest all things righteously: thinking it not agreeable with thy power to condemn him that hath not deserved to be punished. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For thy power is the beginning of righteousness, and because thou art the Lord of all, it maketh thee to be gracious unto all. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For when men will not believe that thou art of a full power, thou shewest thy strength, and among them that know it thou makest their boldness manifest. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But thou, mastering thy power, judgest with equity, and orderest us with great favour: for thou mayest use power when thou wilt. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But by such works hast thou taught thy people that the just man should be merciful, and hast made thy children to be of a good hope that thou givest repentance for sins. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For if thou didst punish the enemies of thy children, and the condemned to death, with such deliberation, giving them time and place, whereby they might be delivered from their malice: </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>With how great circumspection didst thou judge thine own sons, unto whose fathers thou hast sworn, and made covenants of good promises? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Therefore, whereas thou dost chasten us, thou scourgest our enemies a thousand times more, to the intent that, when we judge, we should carefully think of thy goodness, and when we ourselves are judged, we should look for mercy. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Wherefore, whereas men have lived dissolutely and unrighteously, thou hast tormented them with their own abominations. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For they went astray very far in the ways of error, and held them for gods, which even among the beasts of their enemies were despised, being deceived, as children of no understanding. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Therefore unto them, as to children without the use of reason, thou didst send a judgment to mock them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But they that would not be reformed by that correction, wherein he dallied with them, shall feel a judgment worthy of God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For, look, for what things they grudged, when they were punished, that is, for them whom they thought to be gods; <span class='add'>now</span> being punished in them, when they saw it, they acknowledged him to be the true God, whom before they denied to know: and therefore came extreme damnation upon them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
