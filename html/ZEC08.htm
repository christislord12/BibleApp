I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I was jealous for her with great fury.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> Thus saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span>; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth; and the mountain of the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts the holy mountain.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> Thus saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts; There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his staff in his hand for very age.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> very…: Heb. multitude of days</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> Thus saith the <span class='nd'>LORD</span> of hosts;
