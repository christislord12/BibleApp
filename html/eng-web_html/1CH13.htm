He called that place Perez Uzza, to this day.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>David was afraid of God that day, saying, “How can I bring God’s ark home to me?”  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So David didn’t move the ark with him into David’s city, but carried it aside into Obed-Edom the Gittite’s house.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>God’s ark remained with the family of Obed-Edom in his house three months; and Yahweh blessed Obed-Edom’s house and all that he had. </div><ul class='tnav'>
