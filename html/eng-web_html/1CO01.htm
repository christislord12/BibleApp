Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I thank God that I baptized none of you, except Crispus and Gaius,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>so that no one should say that I had baptized you into my own name.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>(I also baptized the household of Stephanas; besides them, I don’t know whether I baptized any other.)  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the Good News—not in wisdom of words, so that the cross of Christ wouldn’t be made void.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are dying, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For it is written, </div><div class='q'>“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise. </div><div class='q2'>I will bring the discernment of the discerning to nothing.”<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Isaiah 29:14</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the lawyer of this world? Hasn’t God made foolish the wisdom of this world?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For seeing that in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom didn’t know God, it was God’s good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save those who believe.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For Jews ask for signs, Greeks seek after wisdom,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews, and foolishness to Greeks,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God;  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For you see your calling, brothers, that not many are wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, and not many noble;  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>but God chose the foolish things of the world that he might put to shame those who are wise.
