For had they known it, they wouldn’t have crucified the Lord of glory.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But as it is written, </div><div class='q'>“Things which an eye didn’t see, and an ear didn’t hear, </div><div class='q2'>which didn’t enter into the heart of man, </div><div class='q2'>these God has prepared for those who love him.”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Isaiah 64:4</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But to us, God revealed them through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For who among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of the man, which is in him? Even so, no one knows the things of God, except God’s Spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But we received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God, that we might know the things that were freely given to us by God.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>We also speak these things, not in words which man’s wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Now the natural man doesn’t receive the things of God’s Spirit, for they are foolishness to him, and he can’t know them, because they are spiritually discerned.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But he who is spiritual discerns all things, and he himself is judged by no one.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>“For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him?” <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Isaiah 40:13</span></a> But we have Christ’s mind. </div><ul class='tnav'>
