Don’t you know that a little yeast leavens the whole lump?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Purge out the old yeast, that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed in our place.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Therefore let’s keep the feast, not with old yeast, neither with the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I wrote to you in my letter to have no company with sexual sinners;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>yet not at all meaning with the sexual sinners of this world, or with the covetous and extortionists, or with idolaters; for then you would have to leave the world.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But as it is, I wrote to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother who is a sexual sinner, or covetous, or an idolater, or a slanderer, or a drunkard, or an extortionist. Don’t even eat with such a person.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For what do I have to do with also judging those who are outside? Don’t you judge those who are within?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But those who are outside, God judges. “Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Deuteronomy 17:7; 19:19; 21:21; 22:21; 24:7</span></a> </div><ul class='tnav'>
