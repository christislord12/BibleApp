<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 12</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Now concerning spiritual things, brothers, I don’t want you to be ignorant.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>You know that when you were heathen,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> or Gentiles</span></a> you were led away to those mute idols, however you might be led.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Therefore I make known to you that no man speaking by God’s Spirit says, “Jesus is accursed.” No one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” but by the Holy Spirit. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Now there are various kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>There are various kinds of service, and the same Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>There are various kinds of workings, but the same God, who works all things in all.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the profit of all.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit;  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>to another faith, by the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, by the same Spirit;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discerning of spirits; to another different kinds of languages; and to another the interpretation of languages.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But the one and the same Spirit produces all of these, distributing to each one separately as he desires. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all given to drink into one Spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For the body is not one member, but many.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>If the foot would say, “Because I’m not the hand, I’m not part of the body,” it is not therefore not part of the body.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>If the ear would say, “Because I’m not the eye, I’m not part of the body,” it’s not therefore not part of the body.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the smelling be?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body, just as he desired.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>If they were all one member, where would the body be?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But now they are many members, but one body.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The eye can’t tell the hand, “I have no need for you,” or again the head to the feet, “I have no need for you.”  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Those parts of the body which we think to be less honorable, on those we bestow more abundant honor; and our unpresentable parts have more abundant propriety;  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>whereas our presentable parts have no such need. But God composed the body together, giving more abundant honor to the inferior part,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>that there should be no division in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>When one member suffers, all the members suffer with it. When one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>God has set some in the assembly: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracle workers, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, and various kinds of languages.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all miracle workers?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with various languages? Do all interpret?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>But earnestly desire the best gifts. Moreover, I show a most excellent way to you. </div><ul class='tnav'>
