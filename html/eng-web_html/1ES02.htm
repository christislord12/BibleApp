the priests also, and the Levites, and all they whose spirit the Lord had stirred to go up, to build the house for the Lord which is in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And those who lived round about them helped them in all things with silver and gold, with horses and cattle, and with very many gifts that were vowed of a great number whose minds were stirred up <span class='add'>thereto. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>King Cyrus also brought forth the holy vessels of the Lord, which Nabuchodonosor had carried away from Jerusalem, and had set up in his temple of idols.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Now when Cyrus king of the Persians had brought them forth, he delivered them to Mithradates his treasurer,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>and by him they were delivered to <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Another reading is, Simanassar.</span></a> Sanabassar the governor of Judea.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And this was the number of them: A thousand golden cups, a thousand cups of silver, censers of silver twenty nine, vials of gold thirty, and of silver two thousand four hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So all the vessels of gold and of silver were brought up, even five thousand four hundred threescore and nine,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>and were carried back by Sanabassar, together with them of the captivity, from Babylon to Jerusalem. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Ezra 4:7</span></a> But in the time of Artaxerxes king of the Persians Belemus, and Mithradates, and Tabellius, and <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Rehum,</span></a> Rathumus, and Beeltethmus, and <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Shimshai.</span></a> Samellius the scribe, with the others that were in commission with them, dwelling in Samaria and other places, wrote to him against those who lived in Judea and Jerusalem the letter following:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>To king Artaxerxes our Lord, Your servants, Rathumus the recorder, and Samellius the scribe, and the rest of their council, and the judges that are in Coelesyria and Phoenicia.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Be it now known to our lord the king, that the Jews that have come up from you to us, having come to Jerusalem, are building that rebellious and wicked city, and and repair its marketplaces and walls, and laying the foundation of a temple.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Now if this city is built and the walls <span class='add'>thereof</span> are finished, they will not only refuse to give tribute, but will even stand up against kings.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And forasmuch as the things pertaining to the temple are now in hand, we think it meet not to neglect such a matter,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>but to speak to our lord the king, to the intent that, if it be your pleasure, search may be made in the books of your fathers:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>and you shall find in the chronicles what is written concerning these things, and shall understand that that city was rebellious, troubling both kings and cities:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>and that the Jews were rebellious, and raised always wars therein of old time; for the which cause even this city was laid waste.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Wherefore now we do declare to you, O lord the king, that if this city be built again, and the walls thereof set up anew, you shall from henceforth have no passage into Coelesyria and Phoenicia.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then the king wrote back again to Rathumus the recorder, and Beeltethmus, and Samellius the scribe, and to the rest that were in commission, and lived in Samaria and Syria and Phoenicia, after this manner:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>I have read the letter which you° have sent to me: therefore I commanded to make search, and it has been found that that city of old time has made insurrection against kings;  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>and the men were given to rebellion and war therein: and that mighty kings and fierce were in Jerusalem, who reigned and exacted tribute in Coelesyria and Phoenicia.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Now therefore I have commanded to hinder those men from building the city, and heed to be taken that there be nothing done contrary to this <span class='add'>order; </span>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>and that those wicked doings proceed no further to the annoyance of kings.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Then king Artaxerxes his letters being read, Rathumus, and Samellius the scribe, and the rest that were in commission with them, removing in haste to Jerusalem with horsemen and a multitude of people in battle array, began to hinder the builders; and the building of the temple in Jerusalem ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of the Persians. </div><ul class='tnav'>
