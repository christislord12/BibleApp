Now it is in the world already.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>You are of God, little children, and have overcome them; because greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>They are of the world. Therefore they speak of the world, and the world hears them.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>We are of God. He who knows God listens to us. He who is not of God doesn’t listen to us.
