And those who were with Judas sounded their trumpets,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>and joined battle, and the Gentiles were discomfited, and fled into the plain.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But all the hindmost fell by the sword: and they pursued them to <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr.

But stand you° now against our enemies, and fight against them, and afterwards take the spoils with boldness.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>While Judas was yet making an end of these words, there appeared a part of them looking out from the mountain:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>and they saw that their army had been put to flight, and that the Jews were burning the camp; for the smoke that was seen declared what was done.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But when they perceived these things, they were sore afraid; and perceiving also the army of Judas in the plain ready for battle,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>they fled all of them into the land of the <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. strangers. </span></a> Philistines.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Judas returned to plunder the camp, and they got much gold, and silver, and blue, and sea purple, and great riches.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And they returned home, and sang a song of thanksgiving, and gave praise <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Or, looking up to heaven </span></a> to heaven;

and Judas met them with ten thousand men.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And he saw that the army was strong, and he prayed and said, </div><div class='p'>Blessed are you, O Savior of Israel, who did quell the onset of the mighty man by the hand of your servant David, and did deliver the army of the <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. strangers. </span></a> Philistines into the hands of Jonathan the son of Saul, and of his armor bearer:  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>shut up this army in the hand of your people Israel, and let them be ashamed for their army and their horsemen:  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>give them faintness of heart, and cause the boldness of their strength to melt away, and let them quake at their destruction:  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>cast them down with the sword of those who love you, and let all that know your name praise you with thanksgiving. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And they joined battle;
