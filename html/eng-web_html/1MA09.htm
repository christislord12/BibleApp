 <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the rest of the acts of Judas, and his wars, and the valiant deeds which he did, and his greatness, they are not written; for they were exceedingly many. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And it came to pass after the death of Judas, that the lawless put forth their heads in all the coasts of Israel, and all those who did iniquity rose up  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>(in those days there was an exceedingly great famine), and the country went over with them.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Bacchides chose out the ungodly men, and made them lords of the country.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And they sought out and searched for the friends of Judas, and brought them to Bacchides, and he took vengeance on them, and used them despitefully.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And there was great suffering in Israel, such as was not since the time that no prophet appeared to them.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And all the friends of Judas were gathered together, and they said to Jonathan,  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Since your brother Judas has died, we have no man like him to go forth against our enemies and Bacchides, and among them of our nation that hate us.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Now therefore we have chosen you this day to be our prince and leader in his stead, that you may fight our battles.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And Jonathan took the governance upon him at that time, and rose up in the stead of his brother Judas. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And Bacchides knew it, and he sought to kill him.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And Jonathan, and Simon his brother, and all that were with him, knew it; and they fled into the wilderness of Tekoah, and encamped by the water of the pool Asphar.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And Bacchides knew it on the Sabbath day, and came, he and all his army, over Jordan.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>Jonathan </span> sent his brother, a leader of the multitude, and implored his friends the Nabathaeans, that they might leave with them their baggage, which was much.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And the children of Jambri came out of Medaba, and took John, and all that he had, and went their way with it. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>But after these things they brought word to Jonathan and Simon his brother, that the children of Jambri were making a great marriage, and were bringing the bride from Nadabath with a great train, a daughter of one of the great nobles of Canaan.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And they remembered John their brother, and went up, and hid themselves under the covert of the mountain:  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>and they lifted up their eyes, and saw, and, behold, a great ado and much baggage: and the bridegroom came forth, and his friends and his kindred, to meet them with timbrels, and minstrels, and many weapons.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And they rose up against them from their ambush, and killed them, and many fell wounded to death, and the remnant fled into the mountain, and they took all their spoils.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And the marriage was turned into mourning, and the voice of their minstrels into lamentation.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And they avenged fully the blood of their brother, and turned back to the marsh of Jordan. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And Bacchides heard it, and he came on the Sabbath day to the banks of Jordan with a great army.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And Jonathan said to his company, Let’s stand up now and fight for our lives, for it is not <span class='add'>with us </span> today, as yesterday and the day before.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>For, behold, the battle is before us and behind us; moreover the water of the Jordan is on this side and on that side, and marsh and wood; and there is no place to escape.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Now therefore cry to heaven, that you° may be delivered out of the hand of your enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And the battle was joined, and Jonathan stretched forth his hand to strike Bacchides, and he turned away back from him.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>And Jonathan and those who were with him leapt into the Jordan, and swam over to the other side: and they didn’t pass over Jordan against them.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>And there fell of Bacchides’ company that day about a thousand men;  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>and he returned to Jerusalem.

At that time was Alcimus stricken, and his works were hindered; and his mouth was stopped, and he was taken with a palsy, and he could no more speak anything and give order concerning his house.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>And Alcimus died at that time with great torment.  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>And Bacchides saw that Alcimus was dead, and he returned to the king: and the land of Judah had rest two years. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>And all the lawless men took counsel, saying, Behold, Jonathan and they of his part are dwelling at ease, and in security: now therefore we will bring Bacchides, and he shall lay hands on them all in one night.  <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>And they went and consulted with him.  <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>And he removed, and came with a great army, and sent letters privily to all his allies that were in Judea, that they should lay hands on Jonathan and those that were with him: and they could not, because their counsel was known to them.  <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>those who were of Jonathan’s part </span> laid hands on about fifty of the men of the country, that were authors of the wickedness, and he killed them.  <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>And Jonathan, and Simon, and those who were with him, got them away to Bethbasi, which is in the wilderness, and he built up that which had been pulled down thereof, and they made it strong.  <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>And Bacchides knew it, and he gathered together all his multitude, and sent word to those who were of Judea.  <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#160;</span>And he went and encamped against Bethbasi, and fought against it many days, and made engines of war.  <span class="verse" id="V65">65&#160;</span>And Jonathan left his brother Simon in the city, and went forth into the country, and he went with a few men.  <span class="verse" id="V66">66&#160;</span>And he struck Odomera and his kindred, and the children of Phasiron in their tent.  <span class="verse" id="V67">67&#160;</span>And they began to strike them, and to go up with their forces. And Simon and those who were with him went out of the city, and set on fire the engines of war,  <span class="verse" id="V68">68&#160;</span>and fought against Bacchides, and he was discomfited by them, and they afflicted him sore; for his counsel was in vain, and his inroad.  <span class="verse" id="V69">69&#160;</span>And they were very angry with the lawless men that gave him counsel to come into the country, and they killed many of them. And he took counsel to depart into his own land.  <span class="verse" id="V70">70&#160;</span>And Jonathan had knowledge thereof, and sent ambassadors to him, to the end that they should make peace with him, and that he should restore to them the captives.  <span class="verse" id="V71">71&#160;</span>And he accepted the thing, and did according to his words, and sware to him that he would not seek his hurt all the days of his life.  <span class="verse" id="V72">72&#160;</span>And he restored to him the captives which he had taken aforetime out of the land of Judah, and he returned and departed into his own land, and came not any more into their borders.  <span class="verse" id="V73">73&#160;</span>And the sword ceased from Israel.
