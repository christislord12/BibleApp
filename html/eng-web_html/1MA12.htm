And he turned toward Joppa, and took possession of it;  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>for he had heard that they were minded to deliver the stronghold to the men of Demetrius; and he set a garrison there to keep it. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And Jonathan returned, and called the elders of the people together; and he took counsel with them to build strongholds in Judea,  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>and to make the walls of Jerusalem higher, and to raise a great mound between the citadel and the city, for to separate it from the city, that so it might be all alone, that men might neither buy nor sell.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And they were gathered together to build the city, and there fell down part of the wall of the brook that is on the east side, and he repaired that which is called Chaphenatha.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And Simon also built Adida in the <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr.
