When the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The children of Israel said to Samuel, “Don’t stop crying to Yahweh our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.”  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Samuel took a suckling lamb, and offered it for a whole burnt offering to Yahweh. Samuel cried to Yahweh for Israel; and Yahweh answered him.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines came near to battle against Israel; but Yahweh thundered with a great thunder on that day on the Philistines, and confused them; and they were struck down before Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The men of Israel went out of Mizpah, and pursued the Philistines, and struck them, until they came under Beth Kar. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and called its name Ebenezer,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> “Ebenezer” means “stone of help”.</span></a> saying, “Yahweh helped us until now.”  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So the Philistines were subdued, and they stopped coming within the border of Israel. Yahweh’s hand was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even to Gath; and Israel recovered its border out of the hand of the Philistines. There was peace between Israel and the Amorites. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He went from year to year in a circuit to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah; and he judged Israel in all those places.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>His return was to Ramah, for his house was there; and he judged Israel there; and he built an altar to Yahweh there. </div><ul class='tnav'>
