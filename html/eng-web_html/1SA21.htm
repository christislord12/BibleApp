Ahimelech came to meet David trembling, and said to him, “Why are you alone, and no man with you?”  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>David said to Ahimelech the priest, “The king has commanded me to do something, and has said to me, ‘Let no one know anything about the business about which I send you, and what I have commanded you. I have sent the young men to a certain place.’  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Now therefore what is under your hand? Please give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or whatever is available.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The priest answered David, and said, “I have no common bread, but there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>David answered the priest, and said to him, “Truly, women have been kept from us as usual these three days. When I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was only a common journey. How much more then today shall their vessels be holy?”  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>So the priest gave him holy bread; for there was no bread there but the show bread that was taken from before Yahweh, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before Yahweh; and his name was Doeg the Edomite, the best of the herdsmen who belonged to Saul.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>David said to Ahimelech, “Isn’t there here under your hand spear or sword? For I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king’s business required haste.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The priest said, “Behold, the sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of Elah, is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you would like to take that, take it; for there is no other except that here.” </div><div class='p'>David said, “There is none like that. Give it to me.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The servants of Achish said to him, “Isn’t this David the king of the land? Didn’t they sing to one another about him in dances, saying, </div><div class='q'>‘Saul has slain his thousands, </div><div class='q2'>and David his ten thousands?’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>David laid up these words in his heart, and was very afraid of Achish the king of Gath.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He changed his behavior before them, and pretended to be insane in their hands, and scribbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down on his beard.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then Achish said to his servants, “Look, you see the man is insane. Why then have you brought him to me?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? Should this fellow come into my house?” </div><ul class='tnav'>
