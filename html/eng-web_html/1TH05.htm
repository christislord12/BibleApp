Then they will in no way escape.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But you, brothers, aren’t in darkness, that the day should overtake you like a thief.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>You are all children of light and children of the day. We don’t belong to the night, nor to darkness,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>so then let’s not sleep, as the rest do, but let’s watch and be sober.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For those who sleep, sleep in the night; and those who are drunk are drunk in the night.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But since we belong to the day, let’s be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For God didn’t appoint us to wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Therefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as you also do.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But we beg you, brothers, to know those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>and to respect and honor them in love for their work’s sake. </div><div class='p'>Be at peace among yourselves.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>We exhort you, brothers: Admonish the disorderly; encourage the faint-hearted; support the weak; be patient toward all.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>See that no one returns evil for evil to anyone, but always follow after that which is good for one another and for all. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Always rejoice.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Pray without ceasing.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>In everything give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Don’t quench the Spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Don’t despise prophecies.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Test all things, and hold firmly that which is good.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Abstain from every form of evil. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>May the God of peace himself sanctify you completely. May your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>He who calls you is faithful, who will also do it.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Brothers, pray for us.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>I solemnly command you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the holy brothers. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
