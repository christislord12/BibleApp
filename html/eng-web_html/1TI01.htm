However, I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>However, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first, Jesus Christ might display all his patience for an example of those who were going to believe in him for eternal life.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone is wise, be honor and glory forever and ever.
