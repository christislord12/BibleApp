Exercise yourself toward godliness.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For bodily exercise has some value, but godliness has value in all things, having the promise of the life which is now, and of that which is to come.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>This saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For to this end we both labor and suffer reproach, because we have set our trust in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Command and teach these things. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Let no man despise your youth; but be an example to those who believe, in word, in your way of life, in love, in spirit, in faith, and in purity.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Until I come, pay attention to reading, to exhortation, and to teaching.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Don’t neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the elders.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Be diligent in these things. Give yourself wholly to them, that your progress may be revealed to all.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Pay attention to yourself and to your teaching. Continue in these things, for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you. </div><ul class='tnav'>
