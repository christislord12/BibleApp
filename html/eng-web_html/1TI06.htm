Teach and exhort these things. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>If anyone teaches a different doctrine, and doesn’t consent to sound words, the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>he is conceited, knowing nothing, but obsessed with arguments, disputes, and word battles, from which come envy, strife, insulting, evil suspicions,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>constant friction of people of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of gain. Withdraw yourself from such. <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> NU omits “Withdraw yourself from such.”</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But godliness with contentment is great gain.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For we brought nothing into the world, and we certainly can’t carry anything out.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But having food and clothing, we will be content with that.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But those who are determined to be rich fall into a temptation, a snare, and many foolish and harmful lusts, such as drown men in ruin and destruction.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some have been led astray from the faith in their greed, and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But you, man of God, flee these things, and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance, and gentleness.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Fight the good fight of faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called, and you confessed the good confession in the sight of many witnesses.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I command you before God, who gives life to all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate testified the good confession,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>that you keep the commandment without spot, blameless, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>which in its own times he will show, who is the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings, and Lord of lords.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen, nor can see: to whom be honor and eternal power.
