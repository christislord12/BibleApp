My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king asked, saying, “Come to me again the third day.”  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam abandoned the counsel of the old men,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So the king didn’t listen to the people; for it was brought about by God, that Yahweh might establish his word, which he spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>When all Israel saw that the king didn’t listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, “What portion do we have in David? We don’t have an inheritance in the son of Jesse! Every man to your tents, Israel! Now see to your own house, David.” So all Israel departed to their tents. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the men subject to forced labor; and the children of Israel stoned him to death with stones. King Rehoboam hurried to get himself up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>So Israel rebelled against David’s house to this day. </div><ul class='tnav'>
