He didn’t humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from Yahweh’s mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God; but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart against turning to Yahweh, the God of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Moreover all the chiefs of the priests, and the people, trespassed very greatly after all the abominations of the nations; and they polluted Yahweh’s house which he had made holy in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Yahweh, the God of their fathers, sent to them by his messengers, rising up early and sending, because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place;  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>but they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and scoffed at his prophets, until Yahweh’s wrath arose against his people, until there was no remedy. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Therefore he brought on them the king of the Chaldeans, who killed their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion on young man or virgin, old man or gray-headed.
