Or if we are of sober mind, it is for you.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For the love of Christ constrains us; because we judge thus, that one died for all, therefore all died.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He died for all, that those who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who for their sakes died and rose again.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Therefore we know no one after the flesh from now on. Even though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now we know him so no more.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away. Behold,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> “Behold”, from “ἰδοὺ”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at.
