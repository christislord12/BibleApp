Your zeal has stirred up very many of them.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>But I have sent the brothers that our boasting on your behalf may not be in vain in this respect, that, just as I said, you may be prepared,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>lest by any means, if anyone from Macedonia comes there with me and finds you unprepared, we (to say nothing of you) would be disappointed in this confident boasting.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>I thought it necessary therefore to entreat the brothers that they would go before to you and arrange ahead of time the generous gift that you promised before, that the same might be ready as a matter of generosity, and not of greediness. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Remember this: he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly. He who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Let each man give according as he has determined in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And God is able to make all grace abound to you, that you, always having all sufficiency in everything, may abound to every good work.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>As it is written, </div><div class='q'>“He has scattered abroad.
