<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 12</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>It is doubtless not profitable for me to boast. For I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I don’t know, or whether out of the body, I don’t know; God knows), such a one caught up into the third heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I know such a man (whether in the body, or outside of the body, I don’t know; God knows),  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>how he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except in my weaknesses.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For if I would desire to boast, I will not be foolish; for I will speak the truth. But I refrain, so that no man may think more of me than that which he sees in me or hears from me.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>By reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, that I should not be exalted excessively, a thorn in the flesh was given to me: a messenger of Satan to torment me, that I should not be exalted excessively.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Concerning this thing, I begged the Lord three times that it might depart from me.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>He has said to me, <span class='wj'>“My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.”</span> Most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest on me. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, and in distresses, for Christ’s sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I have become foolish in boasting. You compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by you, for I am in no way inferior to the very best apostles, though I am nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all perseverance, in signs and wonders and mighty works.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For what is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the assemblies, unless it is that I myself was not a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you; for I seek not your possessions, but you. For the children ought not to save up for the parents, but the parents for the children.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Even so, I myself didn’t burden you. “But, being crafty, I caught you with deception.”  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Did I take advantage of you by anyone of those whom I have sent to you?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? Didn’t we walk in the same spirit? Didn’t we walk in the same steps? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Again, do you think that we are excusing ourselves to you? In the sight of God we speak in Christ. But all things, beloved, are for your edifying.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For I am afraid that by any means, when I come, I might find you not the way I want to, and that I might be found by you as you don’t desire, that by any means there would be strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, slander, whisperings, proud thoughts, or riots,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>that again when I come my God would humble me before you, and I would mourn for many of those who have sinned before now, and not repented of the uncleanness, sexual immorality, and lustfulness which they committed. </div><ul class='tnav'>
