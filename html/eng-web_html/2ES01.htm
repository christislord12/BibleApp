<div class='mt'>THE SECOND BOOK OF ESDRAS </div><div class='ip'><span class='bk'>The Second Book of Esdras</span> is included in the Slavonic Bible as <span class='bk'>3 Esdras</span>, but is not found in the Greek Septuagint. It is included in the Appendix to the Latin Vulgate Bible as <span class='bk'>4 Esdras</span>. It is considered to be Apocrypha by most church traditions. It is preserved here for its supplementary historical value.

but they have provoked me to wrath, and have despised my counsels.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Shake you then the hair of your head, and cast all evils upon them, for they have not been obedient to my law, but it is a rebellious people.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>How long shall I forbear them, to whom I have done so much good?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I have overthrown many kings for their sakes; I have struck down Pharoah with his servants and all his army.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I have destroyed all the nations before them, and in the east I have scattered the people of two provinces, even of Tyre and Sidon, and have slain all their adversaries.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Speak therefore to them, saying, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The Lord says, of a truth I brought you through the sea, and where there was no path I made for you highways; I gave you Moses for a leader, and Aaron for a priest.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I gave you light in a pillar of fire, and great wonders have I done among you; yet have you° forgotten me, says the Lord. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The Lord Almighty says, The quails were for a token to you; I gave you a camp for your protection, nevertheless you° murmured there:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>and you° triumphed not in my name for the destruction of your enemies, but ever to this day do you° yet murmur.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Where are the benefits that I have done for you? when you° were hungry and thirsty in the wilderness, did you° not cry to me,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>saying, Why have you brought us into this wilderness to kill us? it had been better for us to have served the Egyptians, than to die in this wilderness.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>I had pity upon your mourning, and gave you manna for food; you° did eat angels’ bread.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>When you° were thirsty, did I not cleave the rock, and waters flowed out to your fill? for the heat I covered you with the leaves of the trees.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>I divided among you fruitful lands; I cast out the Canaanites, the Pherezites, and the Philistines, before you: what shall I yet do more for you?

you, Judah, would not obey me: I will turn me to other nations, and I will give my name to them, that they may keep my statutes.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Seeing you° have forsaken me, I also will forsake you; when you° ask me to be merciful to you, I will have no mercy upon you.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Whenever you° shall call upon me, I will not hear you: for you° have defiled your hands with blood, and your feet are swift to commit manslaughter.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>You° have not as it were forsaken me, but your own selves, says the Lord. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>The Lord Almighty says, Have I not prayed you as a father his sons, as a mother her daughters, and a nurse her young babes,  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>that you° would be my people, and I should be your God; that you° would be my children, and I should be your father?
