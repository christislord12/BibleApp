And you did set apart Jacob for yourself, but did put by Esau: and Jacob became a great multitude.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And it came to pass, that when you led his seed out of Egypt, you brought them up to the mount Sinai.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>You bowed the heavens also, and did <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> So some versions. Lat. set fast. </span></a> shake the earth, and movedst the whole world, and made the depths to tremble, and troubled the <span class='add'>course of that </span> age.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And your glory went through four gates, of fire, and of earthquake, and of wind, and of cold; that you might give the law to the seed of Jacob, and the commandment to the generation of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And yet took you not away from them <span class='add'>their </span> <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Or, corrupt </span></a> wicked heart, that your law might bring forth fruit in them.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For the first Adam bearing a <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Or, corrupt </span></a> wicked heart transgressed, and was overcome; <span class='add'>and not he only, </span> but all they also that are born of him.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Thus disease was made permanent; and the law was in the heart of the people along with the <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Or, corruption </span></a> wickedness of the root; so the good departed away, and that which was <a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Or, corrupt </span></a> wicked abode still.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>So the times passed away, and the years were brought to an end: then did you raise you up a servant, called David,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>whom you commanded to build a city to your name, and to offer oblations to you therein of your own.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>When this was done many years, then those who inhabited the city did evil,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>in all things doing even as Adam and all his generations had done: for they also bare a <a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Or, corrupt </span></a> wicked heart:  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>and so you gave your city over into the hands of your enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And I said then in my heart, are their deeds any better that inhabit Babylon? and has she therefore dominion over Sion?  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For it came to pass when I came here, that I saw also impieties without number, and my soul saw many evil-doers in this thirties year, so that my heart failed me.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For I have seen how you suffer them sinning, and have spared the ungodly doers, and have destroyed your people, and have preserved your enemies; and you have not signified  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>to any <a href="#FN9" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> So the Syriac.
