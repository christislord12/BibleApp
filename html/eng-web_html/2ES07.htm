Then he said to me, There is a sea set in a wide place, that it might be <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> So the chief Oriental versions. The Latin MSS. have deep. </span></a> broad and vast.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But the entrance thereof shall be set in a narrow place so as to be like a river;  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>whoso then should desire to go into the sea to look upon it, or to rule it, if he went not through the narrow, how could he come into the broad?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Another thing also: There is a city built and set in a plain country, and full of all good things;  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>but the entrance thereof is narrow, and is set in a dangerous place to fall, having a fire on the right hand, and on the left a deep water:  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>and there is one only path between them both, even between the fire and the water, <span class='add'>so small </span> that there could but one man go there at once.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>If this city now be given to a man for an inheritance, if the heir pass not the danger before him, how shall he receive his inheritance?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And I said, It is so, Lord. Then said he to me, Even so also is Israel’s portion.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Because for their sakes I made the world: and when Adam transgressed my statutes, then was decreed that now is done.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then were the entrances of this world made narrow, and sorrowful and toilsome: they are but few and evil, full of perils, and charged with great toils.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For the entrances of the greater world are wide and sure, and bring forth fruit of immortality.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>If then those who live enter not these strait and vain things, they can never receive those that are laid up for them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Now therefore why you disquiet yourself, seeing you are but a corruptible man? and why are you moved, whereas you are but mortal?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>and why have you not considered in your mind that which is to come, rather than that which is present?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then answered I and said, O Lord that bear rule, behold, you have ordained in your law, that the righteous should inherit these things, but that the ungodly should perish.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The righteous therefore shall suffer strait things, and hope for wide: but those who have done wickedly <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> According to some authorities, have not suffered...and shall not see. </span></a> have suffered the strait things, and yet shall not see the wide.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he said to me, <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Another reading is, There is no judge...and none that has understanding. </span></a> You are not a judge above God, neither have you understanding above the Most High.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Yes, rather let many that now be perish, than that the law of God which is set before them be despised.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For God straitly commanded such as came, even as they came, what they should do to live, and what they should observe to avoid punishment.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Nevertheless they were not obedient to him; but spoke against him, and imagined for themselves vain things;  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>and framed cunning plans of wickedness; and said moreover of the Most High, that he is not; and knew not his ways:  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>but they despised his law, and denied his covenants; they have not been faithful to his statutes, and have not performed his works.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Therefore, Esdras, for the empty are empty things, and for the full are the full things.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For behold, the time shall come, and it shall be, when these tokens, of which I told you before, shall come to pass, that the bride shall appear, even the city coming forth, and she shall be seen, that now is withdrawn from the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And whoever is delivered from the aforesaid evils shall see my wonders.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For my son Jesus shall be revealed with those that be with him, and shall rejoice those who remain four hundred years.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>After these years shall my son Christ die of those who, and all that have the breath of <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Lat. man </span></a> life.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And the world shall be turned into the old silence seven days, like as in the first beginning: so that no man shall remain.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And after seven days the world, that yet awakens not, shall be raised up, and that shall die that is corruptible.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the earth shall restore those that are asleep in her, and so shall the dust those that dwell therein in silence, and the <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Or, chambers See 2 Esdras 4:35. </span></a> secret places shall deliver those souls that were committed to them.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And the Most High shall be revealed upon the seat of judgement, <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> The Syriac adds and the end shall come. </span></a> and compassion shall pass away, and patience shall be withdrawn:  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>but judgement only shall remain, truth shall stand, and faith shall wax strong:  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>and the work shall follow, and the reward shall be showed, and good deeds shall awake, and wicked deeds shall not sleep. <a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> The passage from verse [36] to verse [105], formerly missing, has been restored to the text.

<span class='add'>what shall I say? </span> for who is there of those who are alive that has not sinned, and who of the sons <span class='add'>of men </span> that has not transgressed your covenant?  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And now I see, that the world to come shall bring delight to few, but torments to many.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>For an evil heart has grown up in us, which has led us astray from these <span class='add'>statutes, </span> and has brought us into corruption and into the ways of death, has showed us the paths of perdition and removed

id="V51">51&#160;</span>For whereas you have said that the just are not many, but few, and the ungodly abound, hear <span class='add'>the answer </span> thereto.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>If you have exceedingly few choice stones, <a href="#FN12" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> The Latin is here corrupt. </span></a> will you set for you near them

than gold, and brass than silver, and iron than brass, lead than iron, and clay than lead.  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>Judge you therefore which things are precious and to be desired,

also is the <a href="#FN14" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> The Latin is here corrupt. </span></a> judgement which I have promised: for I will rejoice over the few that shall be saved, inasmuch as these are those who have made my glory now to prevail, and of whom my name is now named.  <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>And I will not grieve over the multitude of those who perish; for these are those who are now like to vapor, and are become as flame and smoke; they are set on fire and burn hotly, and are quenched. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>And I answered and said, O you earth, wherefore have you brought forth, if the mind is made out of dust, like as all other created things?  <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>For it were better that the dust itself had been unborn, so that the mind might not have been made therefrom.  <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#160;</span>But now the mind grows with us, and by reason of this we are tormented, because we perish and know it.  <span class="verse" id="V65">65&#160;</span>Let the race of men lament and the beasts of the field be glad; let all that are born lament, but let the four-footed beasts and the cattle rejoice.  <span class="verse" id="V66">66&#160;</span>For it is far better with them than with us; for they look not for judgement, neither do they know of torments or of salvation promised to them after death.  <span class="verse" id="V67">67&#160;</span>For what does it profit us, that we shall be preserved alive, but yet be afflicted with torment?  <span class="verse" id="V68">68&#160;</span>For all that are born are <a href="#FN15" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> The Latin is here corrupt. </span></a> defiled with iniquities, and are full of sins and laden with offences:  <span class="verse" id="V69">69&#160;</span>and if after death we were not to come into judgement, perhaps it had been better for us. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V70">70&#160;</span>And he answered me, and said, When the Most High made the world, and Adam and all those who came of him, he first prepared the Judgement and the things that pertain to the judgement.  <span class="verse" id="V71">71&#160;</span>And now understand from your own words, for you have said that the mind grows with us.  <span class="verse" id="V72">72&#160;</span>They therefore that dwell upon the earth shall be tormented for this reason, that having understanding they have done iniquity, and receiving commandments have not kept them, and having obtained a law they dealt unfaithfully with that which they received.  <span class="verse" id="V73">73&#160;</span>What then will they have to say in the judgement, or how will they answer in the last times?  <span class="verse" id="V74">74&#160;</span>For how great a time has the Most High been patient with those who inhabit the world, and not for their sakes, but because of the times which he has foreordained! </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V75">75&#160;</span>And I answered and said, if I have found grace in your sight, O Lord, show this also to your servant, whether after death, even now when every one of us gives up his soul, we shall be kept in rest until those times come, in which you shall renew the creation, or whether we shall be tormented forthwith. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V76">76&#160;</span>And he answered me, and said, I will show you this also; but join not yourself with those who are scorners, nor

be showed you until the last times.  <span class="verse" id="V78">78&#160;</span>For concerning death the teaching is: When the determinate sentence has gone forth from the Most High that a man should die, as the spirit leaves the body to return again to him who gave it, it adores the glory of the Most High first of all.  <span class="verse" id="V79">79&#160;</span>And if it be one of those that

<span class="verse" id="V81">81&#160;</span>The first way, because they have despised the law of the Most High.  <span class="verse" id="V82">82&#160;</span>The second way, because they can’t now make a good returning that they may live.  <span class="verse" id="V83">83&#160;</span>The third way, they shall see the reward laid up for those who have believed the covenants of the Most High.  <span class="verse" id="V84">84&#160;</span>The fourth way, they shall consider the torment laid up for themselves in the last days.  <span class="verse" id="V85">85&#160;</span>The fifth way, they shall see the dwelling places of the others guarded by angels, with great quietness.  <span class="verse" id="V86">86&#160;</span>The sixth way, they shall see <a href="#FN17" class="notemark">*<span

class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Lat. greater </span></a> more grievous than all the aforesaid ways, because they shall pine away in confusion and be consumed with <a href="#FN19" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> The Latin is here corrupt. </span></a> shame, and shall be withered up by fears, seeing the glory of the Most High before whom they have sinned while living, and before whom they shall be judged in the last times.  <span class="verse" id="V88">88&#160;</span>Now this is the order of those who have kept the ways of the Most High, when they shall be separated from the corruptible vessel.  <span class="verse" id="V89">89&#160;</span>In the time <a href="#FN20" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> The Latin is here corrupt. </span></a> that they lived therein they painfully served the Most High, and were in jeopardy every hour, that they might keep the law of the lawgiver perfectly.  <span class="verse" id="V90">90&#160;</span>Wherefore this is the teaching concerning them:  <span class="verse" id="V91">91&#160;</span>First of all they shall see with great joy the glory of him who takes them up, for they shall have rest in seven orders.  <span class="verse" id="V92">92&#160;</span>The first order, because they have labored with great effort to overcome the evil thought which was fashioned together with them, that it might not lead them astray from life into death.  <span class="verse" id="V93">93&#160;</span>The second order, because they see the perplexity in which the souls of the ungodly wander, and the punishment that awaits them.  <span class="verse" id="V94">94&#160;</span>The third order, they see the witness which he that fashioned them bears concerning them, that while they lived they kept the law which was given them in trust.  <span class="verse" id="V95">95&#160;</span>The fourth order, they understand the rest which, being gathered in their chambers, they now enjoy with great quietness, guarded by angels, and the glory that awaits them in the last days.  <span class="verse" id="V96">96&#160;</span>The fifth order, they rejoice, <span class='add'>seeing </span> how they have now escaped from that which is corruptible, and how they shall inherit that which is to come, while they see moreover the straitness and the <a href="#FN21" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> The Latin is here corrupt. </span></a> painfulness from which they have been delivered, and the large room which they shall receive with joy and immortality.  <span class="verse" id="V97">97&#160;</span>The sixth order, when it is showed to them how their face shall shine as the sun, and how they shall be made like to the light of the stars, being henceforth incorruptible.  <span class="verse" id="V98">98&#160;</span>The seventh order, which is greater than all the aforesaid orders, because they shall rejoice with confidence, and because they shall be bold without confusion, and shall be glad without fear, for they hasten to behold the face of him whom in their lifetime they served, and from whom they shall receive <span class='add'>their </span> reward in glory.  <span class="verse" id="V99">99&#160;</span>This is the order of the souls of the just, as from henceforth <a href="#FN22" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> The latin is here corrupt. </span></a> is announcer to them, <span class='add'>and </span> aforesaid are the ways of torture which those who would not give heed shall suffer from henceforth.  <span class="verse" id="V100">100&#160;</span>And I answered and said, shall time therefore
