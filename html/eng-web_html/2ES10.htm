The Latin is corrupt. </span></a> It is right now to mourn very sore, seeing we all mourn, and to be sorrowful, seeing we are all in sorrow, but you sorrowest for one son.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For ask the earth, and she shall tell you, that it is she which ought to mourn for so many that grow upon her.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For out of her all had their beginnings, and others shall come; and, behold, they walk almost all into destruction, and the multitude of them is utterly rooted out.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Who then should make more mourning, <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> So the Syriac. </span></a> she, that has lost so great a multitude, or you, which are grieved but for one?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>but if you say to me, My lamentation is not like the earth’s, for I have lost the fruit of my womb, which I brought forth with pains, and bare with sorrows:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>but <span class='add'>it is with </span> the earth after the manner of the earth; the multitude present in it is gone, as it came:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>then say I to you, Just as you have brought forth with sorrow; even so the earth also has given her fruit, namely, man, ever since the beginning to him that made her.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Now therefore keep your sorrow to yourself, and bear with a good courage the adversities which have befallen you.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For if you shall acknowledge the decree of God to be just, you shall both receive your son in time, and shall be praised among women.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Go your way then into the city to your husband. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And she said to me, “I won’t do that. I will not go into the city, but I will die here.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>So I proceeded to speak further to her, and said,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Do not so, but suffer yourself to be prevailed on by reason of the adversities of Sion; and be comforted by reason of the sorrow of Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For you see that our sanctuary is laid waste, our altar broken down, our temple destroyed;  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>our lute is brought low, our song is put to silence, our rejoicing is at an end; the light of our candlestick is put out, the ark of our covenant is plundered, our holy things are defiled, and the name that is called upon us is profaned; our freemen are despitefully treated, our priests are burned, our Levites are gone into captivity, our virgins are defiled, and our wives ravished; our righteous men carried away, our little ones betrayed, our young men are brought into bondage, and our strong men are become weak;  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>and, what is more than all, the seal of Sion—for she has now lost the seal of her honor, and is delivered into the hands of those who hate us.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>You therefore shake off your great heaviness, and put away from you the multitude of sorrows, that the Mighty may be merciful to you again, and the Most High may give you rest, even ease from your travails. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And it came to pass, while I was talking with her, behold, her face upon a sudden shined exceedingly, and her countenance glistered like lightning, so that I was sore afraid <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> The Syriac has to draw near to her, and my heart was greatly astonied, and when I mused etc. </span></a> of her, and mused what this might be;  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>and, behold, suddenly she made a great cry very fearful; so that the earth shook at the noise.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And I looked, and, behold, the woman appeared to me no more, but there was a city built, and a place showed itself from large foundations: then was I afraid, and cried with a loud voice, and said,  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Where is Uriel the angel, who came to me at the first? for he has caused me to fall into this great trance, and my end is turned into corruption, and my prayer to rebuke.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And as I was speaking these words, behold, the angel who had come to me at the first came to me, and he looked upon me:  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>and, behold, I lay as one that had been dead, and my understanding was taken from me; and he took me by the right hand, and comforted me, and set me upon my feet, and said to me,  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>What ails you? and why are you so disquieted? and why is your understanding troubled, and the thoughts of your heart?  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And I said, Because you have forsaken me: yet I did according to your words, and went into the field, and, behold, I have seen, and yet see, that which I am not able to express.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And he said to me, Stand up like a man, and I will advise you.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Then said I, Speak on, my Lord; only forsake me not, lest I die frustrate of my hope.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>For I have seen that I knew not, and hear that I do not know.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Or is my sense deceived, or my soul in a dream?  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Now therefore I beseech you to show your servant concerning this trance. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And he answered me, and said, Hear me, and I shall inform you, and tell you concerning the things whereof you are afraid: For the Most High has revealed many secret things to you.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>He has seen that your way is right: for that you sorrowest continually for your people, and make great lamentation for Sion.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>This therefore is the meaning of the vision.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>The woman which appeared to you a little while ago, whom you saw mourning, and began to comfort her:  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>but now see you the likeness of the woman no more, but there appeared to you a city in building:  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>and whereas she told you of the death of her son, this is the solution:  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>This woman, whom you saw, is <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> So the Syriac and other versions.

So I slept that night and another, like as he commanded me. </div><ul class='tnav'>
