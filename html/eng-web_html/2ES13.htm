The Latin has grew strong </span></a> flew with the clouds of heaven: and when he turned his countenance to look, all things trembled that were seen under him.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And whenever the voice went out of his mouth, all they burned that heard his voice, like as the <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> So the Syriac and other Oriental versions.</span></a> wax melts when it feels the fire.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And after this I saw, and, behold, there was gathered together a multitude of men, out of number, from the four winds of heaven, to make war against the man that came out of the sea.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And I saw, and, behold, he carved himself a great mountain, and flew upon it.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But I sought to see the region or place whereout the mountain was graven, and I could not.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And after this I saw, and, behold, all they which were gathered together to fight against him were sore afraid, and yet dared fight.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And, behold, as he saw the assault of the multitude that came, he neither lifted up his hand, nor held spear, nor any instrument of war:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>but only I saw how that he sent out of his mouth as it had been a flood of fire, and out of his lips a flaming breath, and out of his tongue he cast forth sparks <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> So the Syriac and Arabic. </span></a> of the storm.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And these were all mixed together; the flood of fire, the flaming breath, and the great storm; and fell upon the assault of the multitude which was prepared to fight, and burned them up every one, so that upon a sudden of an innumerable multitude nothing was to be perceived, but only dust of ashes and smell of smoke: when I saw this I was amazed.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Afterward I saw the same man come down from the mountain, and call to him another multitude which was peaceful.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And there came <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Lat. the faces of many people. </span></a> much people to him, whereof some were glad, some were sorry, some of them were bound, and other some brought of those who were offered: then through great fear I awaked, and prayed to the Most High, and said,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>You have showed your servant these wonders from the beginning, and have counted me worthy that you should receive my prayer:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>and now show me moreover the interpretation of this dream.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For as I conceive in my understanding, woe to those who shall be left in those days! and much more woe to those who are not left!  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>for those who were not left shall be in heaviness,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>understanding the things that are laid up in the latter days, but not attaining to them.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But woe to them also that are left, for this cause; for they shall see great perils and many necessities, like as these dreams declare.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Yet is it <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Lat. easier. </span></a> better for one to be in peril and to come into <a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> So the Syriac. </span></a> these things, than to pass away as a cloud out of the world, and not to see the things that <a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> So the Syriac. </span></a> shall happen in the last days. </div><div class='p'>And he answered to me, and said,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The interpretation of the vision shall I tell you, and I will also open to you the things whereof you have made mention.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Whereas you have spoken of those who are left behind, this is the interpretation:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>He that shall <a href="#FN9" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> So the Syriac. </span></a> endure the peril in that time shall keep those who are fallen into danger, even such as have works, and faith toward the Almighty.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Know therefore, that they which be left behind are more blessed than those who are dead.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>These are the interpretations of the vision: Whereas you saw a man coming up from the midst of the sea,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>this is he whom the Most High has kept a great season, which by his own self shall deliver his creature: and he shall order those who are left behind.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And whereas you saw, that out of his mouth there came wind, and fire, and storm;  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>and whereas he held neither spear, nor any instrument of war, but destroyed the assault of that multitude which came to fight against him; this is the interpretation:  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Behold, the days come, when the Most High will begin to deliver those who are upon the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And there shall come astonishment of mind upon those who dwell on the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And one shall think to war against another, city against city, place against place, people against people, and kingdom against kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And it shall be, when these things shall come to pass, and the signs shall happen which I showed you before, then shall my Son be revealed, whom you saw <span class='add'>as </span> a man ascending.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And it shall be, when all the nations hear his voice, every man shall leave his own land and the battle they have one against another.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And an innumerable multitude shall be gathered together, as you saw, desiring to come, and to fight against him.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>But he shall stand upon the top of the mount Sion.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And Sion shall come, and shall be showed to all men, being prepared and built, like as you saw the mountain graven without hands.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And this my Son shall rebuke the nations which are come for their wickedness, <span class='add'>with plagues </span> that are like to a tempest;  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>and shall taunt them to their face with their evil thoughts, and the torments wherewith they shall be tormented, which are likened to a flame: and he shall destroy them without labor by the law, which is likened to fire.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And whereas you saw that he gathered to him another multitude that was peaceful;  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>these are the ten tribes, which were led away out of their own land in the time of Osea the king, whom Salmananser the king of the Assyrians led away captive, and he carried them beyond the River, and they were carried into another land.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>But they took this counsel among themselves, that they would leave the multitude of the heathen, and go forth into a further country, where never mankind lived,  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>that they might there keep their statutes, which they had not kept in their own land.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And they entered by the narrow passages of the river Euphrates.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>For the Most High then did signs for them, and stayed the springs of the River, till they were passed over.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>For through that country there was a great way to go, namely, of a year and a half: and the same region is called <a href="#FN10" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> That is, another land. See Deuteronomy 29:28. </span></a> Arzareth.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Then lived they there until the latter time; and now when they begin to come again,  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>the Most High stays the springs of the River again, that they may go through: therefore saw you the multitude gathered together with peace.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>But those that be left behind of your people are those who are found within my holy border.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>It shall be therefore when he shall destroy the multitude of the nations that are gathered together, he shall defend the people that remain.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>And then shall he show them very many wonders. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Then said I, O Lord that bear rule, show me this: wherefore I have seen the man coming up from the midst of the sea.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>And he said to me, like as one can neither seek out nor know what is in the deep of the sea, even so can no man upon earth see my Son, or those that be with him, but in the time of <a href="#FN11" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> So the Oriental versions. The Latin omits his. </span></a> his day.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>This is the interpretation of the dream which you saw, and for this you only are enlightened herein.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>For you have forsaken your own <span class='add'>ways, </span> and applied your diligence to mine, and have sought out my law.  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>Your life have you ordered in wisdom, and have called understanding your mother.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>And therefore have I showed you this; for there is a reward laid up with the Most High: and it shall be, after other three days I will speak other things to you, and declare to you mighty and wondrous things.  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>Then went I forth and passed into the field, giving praise and thanks greatly to the Most High because of his wonders, which he did from time to time;  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>and because he governs the time, and such things as fall in their seasons. And there I sat three days. </div><ul class='tnav'>
