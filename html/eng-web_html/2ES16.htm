for your destruction is at hand.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>A sword is sent upon you, and who is he that may turn it back?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>A fire is sent upon you, and who is he that may quench it?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Evils are sent upon you, and who is he that may drive them away?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>May one drive away a hungry lion in the wood? or may one quench the fire in stubble, when it has once begun to burn?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>May one turn again the arrow that is shot of a strong archer?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The Lord God sends the evils, and who shall drive them away?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>A fire shall go forth from his wrath, and who is he that may quench it?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He shall cast lightning, and who shall not fear? he shall thunder, and who shall not tremble?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The Lord shall threaten, and who shall not be utterly broken in pieces at his presence?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The earth quakes, and the foundations thereof; the sea arises up with waves from the deep, and the waves of it shall be troubled, and the fishes thereof also, at the presence of the Lord, and before the glory of his power:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>for strong is his right hand that bends the bow, his arrows that he shoots are sharp, and shall not miss, when they begin to be shot into the ends of the world.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Behold, the evils are sent forth, and shall not return again, until they come upon the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The fire is kindled, and shall not be put out, till it consume the foundations of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Just as an arrow which is shot of a mighty archer returns not backward, even so the evils that are sent forth upon earth shall not return again.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Woe is me! woe is me! who will deliver me in those days? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The beginning of sorrows, and <span class='add'>there shall be </span> great mourning;

and the other, that escape the famine, shall the sword destroy.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the dead shall be cast out as dung, and there shall be no man to comfort them: for the earth shall be left desolate, and the cities thereof shall be cast down.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>There shall be no husbandman left to till the earth, and to sow it.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The trees shall give fruit, and who shall gather them?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>The grapes shall ripen, and who shall tread them? for in <span class='add'>all </span> places there shall be a great forsaking:  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>for one man shall desire to see another, or to hear his voice.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For of a city there shall be ten left, and two of the field, which have hidden themselves in the thick groves, and in the clefts of the rocks.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>As in an orchard of olives upon every tree there be left three or four olives,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>or as when a vineyard is gathered there be some clusters left by those who diligently seek through the vineyard;  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>even so in those days there shall be three or four left by those who search their houses with the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the earth shall be left desolate, and the fields thereof shall be for briers, and her ways and all her paths shall bring forth thorns, because no sheep shall pass therethrough.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>The virgins shall mourn, having no bridegrooms; the women shall mourn, having no husbands; their daughters shall mourn, having no helpers.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>In the wars shall their bridegrooms be destroyed, and their husbands shall perish of famine. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Hear now these things, and understand them, you° servants of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Behold, the word of the Lord, receive it: disbelieve not the things whereof the Lord speaks.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Behold, the evils draw near, and are not slack.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Just as a woman with child in the ninth month, when the hour of her delivery draws near, within two or three hours doleful pains surround her womb, and when the child comes forth from the womb, there shall be no waiting for a moment:  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>even so shall not the evils be slack to come upon the earth, and the world shall groan, and sorrows shall take hold of it on every side.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>O my people, hear my word: make you ready to the battle, and in those evils be even as pilgrims upon the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>He that sells, let him be as he that flees away: and he that buys, as one that will lose:  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>he that occupies merchandise, as he that has no profit by it: and he that builds, as he that shall not dwell therein:  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>he that sows, as if he should not reap: so also he that prunes <span class='add'>the vines, </span> as he that shall not gather the grapes:  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>those who marry, as those who shall get no children;

and it was made: Let the heaven be made; and it was made.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>And at his word were the stars established, and he knows the number of the stars.  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>Who searches the deep, and the treasures thereof; he has measured the sea, and what it contains.  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>Who has shut the sea in the midst of the waters, and with his word has he hanged the earth upon the waters.  <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>Who spreads out the heaven like a vault; upon the waters has he founded it.  <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>Who has made in the desert springs of water, and pools upon the tops of the mountains, to send forth rivers from the height to water the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>Who framed man, and put a heart in the midst of the body, and gave him breath, life, and understanding,  <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>yes, the spirit of God Almighty.
