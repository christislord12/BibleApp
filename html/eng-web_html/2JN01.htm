This is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who don’t confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the Antichrist.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Watch yourselves, that we don’t lose the things which we have accomplished, but that we receive a full reward.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Whoever transgresses and doesn’t remain in the teaching of Christ, doesn’t have God. He who remains in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>If anyone comes to you, and doesn’t bring this teaching, don’t receive him into your house, and don’t welcome him,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>for he who welcomes him participates in his evil deeds. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Having many things to write to you, I don’t want to do so with paper and ink, but I hope to come to you, and to speak face to face, that our joy may be made full.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The children of your chosen sister greet you.
