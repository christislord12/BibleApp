His mother’s name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>He did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes, according to all that his father Amaziah had done.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>However the high places were not taken away. The people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Yahweh struck the king, so that he was a leper to the day of his death, and lived in a separate house. Jotham, the king’s son was over the household, judging the people of the land.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Now the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in David’s city: and Jotham his son reigned in his place. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah king of Judah, Zechariah the son of Jeroboam reigned over Israel in Samaria six months.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, as his fathers had done. He didn’t depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and struck him before the people, and killed him, and reigned in his place.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Now the rest of the acts of Zechariah, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>This was Yahweh’s word which he spoke to Jehu, saying, “Your sons to the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.” So it came to pass. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah king of Judah, and he reigned for a month in Samaria.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, came to Samaria, struck Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, killed him, and reigned in his place.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Now the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he made, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then Menahem attacked Tiphsah, and all who were in it, and its border areas, from Tirzah.
