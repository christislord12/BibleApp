 <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>and drawing of swords; and <span class='add'>on the other side </span> squadrons of horse in array; and encounters and <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Or, charges </span></a> pursuits of both <span class='add'>armies; </span> and shaking of shields, and multitudes of lances, and casting of darts, and flashing of golden trappings, and girding on of all sorts of armor.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Wherefore all men implored that the <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. manifestation. </span></a> vision might have been given for good. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But when a false rumor had arisen that Antiochus was deceased, Jason took not less than a thousand men, and suddenly <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. perpetrated. </span></a> made an assault upon the city; and those who were upon the wall being routed, and the city being now at length well near taken, Menelaus took refuge in the citadel.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But Jason slaughtered his own citizens without mercy, not considering that good success against kinsmen is the greatest ill success, but supposing himself to be setting up trophies over enemies, and not over fellow-countrymen.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The office <span class='add'>however </span> he didn’t get, but, receiving shame as the end of his conspiracy, he passed again a fugitive into the country of the Ammonites.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>At the last therefore he met with a miserable end: having been <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> The Greek text here is uncertain. </span></a> shut up at the court of Aretas the prince of the Arabians, fleeing from city to city, pursued of all men, hated as an apostate from the laws, and held in abomination as the butcher of his country and his fellow-citizens, he was cast forth into Egypt;  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>and he that had driven many from their own country into strange lands perished <span class='add'>himself </span> in a strange land, having crossed the sea to the Lacedaemonians, as thinking to find shelter <span class='add'>there </span> because they were <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> See 1 Maccabees 12:7. </span></a> near of kin;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>and he that had cast out a multitude unburied had none to mourn for him, nor had he any funeral at all, or place in the sepulchre of his fathers. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Now when tidings came to the king concerning that which was done, he thought that Judea was in revolt; whereupon setting out from Egypt in a furious mind, he took the city by force of arms,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>and commanded his soldiers to cut down without mercy such as came in their way, and to kill such as went up upon the houses;  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>and there was killing of young and old, making away of boys, women, and children, slaying of virgins and infants.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And in all the three days <span class='add'>of the slaughter </span> there were destroyed fourscore thousand, <span class='add'>whereof </span> forty thousand <span class='add'>were slain </span> in close combat, and no fewer were sold than slain.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But not content with this he presumed to enter into the most holy temple of all the earth, having Menelaus for his guide (him that had proved himself a traitor both to the laws and to his country),  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>even taking the sacred vessels with his polluted hands, and dragging down with his profane hands the offerings that had been dedicated by other kings to the augmentation and glory and honor of the place.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Antiochus was lifted up in mind, not seeing that because of the sins of those who lived in the city the Sovereign Lord had been provoked to anger a little while, and therefore his eye was <span class='add'>then </span> turned away from the place.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But had it not so been that they were already bound by many sins, this man, even as Heliodorus who was sent by Seleucus the king to view the treasury, would, so soon as he pressed forward, have been scourged and turned back from his daring deed.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>However the Lord didn’t choose the nation for the place’s sake, but the place for the nation’s sake.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Wherefore also the place itself, having shared in the calamities that befell the nation, did afterward share in <span class='add'>its </span> benefits; and the <span class='add'>place </span> which was forsaken in the wrath of the Almighty was, at the reconciliation of the great Sovereign, restored again with all glory.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>As for Antiochus, when he had carried away out of the temple a thousand and eight hundred talents, he departed in all haste to Antioch, thinking in his arrogance to make the land navigable and the sea passable by foot, because his heart was lifted up.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And moreover he left governors to afflict the race: at Jerusalem, Philip, by race a Phrygian, and in character more barbarous than him that set him there;  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>and at Gerizim, Andronicus; and besides these, Menelaus, who worse than all the rest exalted himself against his fellow-citizens. And having a malicious mind <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Some authorities read toward the Jews, he sent.
