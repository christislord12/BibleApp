Zeus. </span></a> Jupiter Olympius, and <span class='add'>to call </span> the <span class='add'>sanctuary </span> in Gerizim by the name of <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr.

Dionysus. </span></a> Bacchus, wearing wreaths of ivy.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>A decree went out to the neighboring Greek cities, by the suggestion of Ptolemy, that they should observe the same conduct against the Jews, and should make them eat of the sacrifices;  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>and that they should kill such as didn’t choose to go over to the Greek rites. So the present misery was for all to see:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>for two women were brought up for having circumcised their children; and these, when they had led them publicly round about the city, with the babes hung from their breasts, they cast down headlong from the wall.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And others, that had run together into the caves near by to keep the seventh day secretly, being betrayed to Philip were all burned together, because they scrupled to defend themselves, from regard to the honor of that most solemn day. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I beseech therefore those that read this book, that they be not discouraged because of the calamities, but account that these punishments were not for the destruction, but for the chastening of our race.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For indeed that those who act impiously be not let alone any long time, but immediately meet with retribution, is a sign of great beneficence.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For in the case of the other nations the Sovereign Lord does with patience forbear, until that he punish them when they have attained to the full measure of <span class='add'>their </span> sins; but not so judged he as touching us,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>that he may not take vengeance on us afterward, <a href="#FN9" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Or, when our sins be come to their height </span></a> when we be come to the <a href="#FN10" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. end. </span></a> height of our sins.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Wherefore he never withdraws his mercy from us; but though he chastens with calamity, yet does he not forsake his own people.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>However let this that we have spoken suffice to put <span class='add'>you </span> in remembrance; but after <span class='add'>these </span> few words we must come to the narrative. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Eleazar, one of the principal scribes, a man already well stricken in years, and of a noble countenance, was compelled to open his mouth to eat swine’s flesh.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But he, welcoming death with renown rather than life with pollution, advanced of his own accord to the instrument of torture, but first spat forth <span class='add'>the flesh,</span>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> <span class='add'>coming forward </span> as men ought to come that are resolute to repel such things as not <span class='add'>even </span> for the natural love of life is it lawful to taste.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But those who had the charge of that forbidden sacrificial feast took the man aside, for the acquaintance which of old times they had with him, and privately implored him to bring flesh of his own providing, such as was befitting for him to use, and to make as if he did eat of the flesh from the sacrifice, as had been commanded by the king;  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>that by so doing he might be delivered from death, and for his ancient friendship with them might be treated kindly.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But he, having formed a high resolve, and one that became his years, and the dignity of old age, and the gray hairs <a href="#FN11" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> The Greek text appears to be corrupt. </span></a> which he had reached with honor, and his excellent <a href="#FN12" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Some authorities read manner of life. </span></a> education from a child, <a href="#FN13" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Or, but yet more </span></a> or rather <span class='add'>that became </span> the holy <a href="#FN14" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. legislation. </span></a> laws of God’s ordaining, declared his mind accordingly, bidding them quickly send him to Hades.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For it becomes not our years to dissemble, <span class='add'>said he, </span> that <span class='add'>through this </span> many of the young should suppose that Eleazar, the man of fourscore years and ten, had gone over to an alien religion;  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>and <span class='add'>so </span> they, by reason of my dissimulation, and for the sake of this brief and momentary life, should be led astray because of me, <a href="#FN15" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Or, while I shall get</span></a> and <span class='add'>thus </span> I get to myself a pollution and a stain of my old age.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For even if for the present time I shall remove from me the punishment of men, yet shall I not escape the hands of the Almighty, either living or dead.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Wherefore, by manfully parting with my life now, I will show myself worthy of my old age,  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>and <a href="#FN16" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. one that has left behind. </span></a> leave behind a noble ensample to the young to die willingly and nobly a glorious death for the reverend and holy laws. And when he had said these words, he went immediately to the instrument of torture.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> <a href="#FN17" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> The Greek text of this verse is uncertain. </span></a> And when they changed the good they will bare him a little before into ill will, because <a href="#FN18" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. the aforesaid words were. </span></a> these words of his were, as they thought, sheer madness,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>and when he was at the point to die with the <a href="#FN19" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Or, blows </span></a> stripes, he groaned aloud and said, To the Lord, that has the holy knowledge, it is manifest that, whereas I might have been delivered from death, I endure sore pains in my body by being scourged; but in soul I gladly suffer these things for my fear of him.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>So this man also died after this manner, leaving his death for an ensample of nobleness and a memorial of virtue, not only to the young but also to the great body of his nation. </div><ul class='tnav'>
