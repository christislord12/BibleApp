and <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. firing. </span></a> striking stones and taking fire out of them, they offered sacrifices, after <span class='add'>they had ceased for </span> two years, and <span class='add'>burned </span> incense, and <span class='add'>lighted </span> lamps, and set forth the show bread.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And when they had done these things, they fell prostrate and implored the Lord that they might fall no more into such evils; but that, if ever they should sin, they might be chastened by him with forbearance, and not be delivered to blaspheming and barbarous heathen.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Now on the same day that the sanctuary was profaned by aliens, upon that very day did it come to pass that the cleansing of the sanctuary was made, even on the five and twentieth day of the same month, which is Chislev.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And they kept eight days with gladness in the manner <span class='add'>of the feast </span> of tabernacles, remembering how that <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Or, not long before they kept the feast of tabernacles by wandering </span></a> not long before, during the feast of tabernacles, they were wandering in the mountains and in the caves after the manner of wild beasts.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Wherefore bearing wands wreathed with leaves, and fair boughs, and palms also, they offered up hymns of thanksgiving to him that had prosperously brought to pass the cleansing of his own place.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>They ordained also with a common statute and decree, for all the nation of the Jews, that they should keep these days every year.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. such were the events of the end </span></a> such was the end of Antiochus, who was called Epiphanes.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But now will we declare what came to pass under Antiochus <span class='add'>named </span> <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> That is, son of a good father. </span></a> Eupator, who proved himself a <span class='add'>true </span> son of that ungodly man, and will gather up briefly the <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Or, chief </span></a> successive evils of the wars.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For this man, when he succeeded to the kingdom, appointed one Lysias <span class='add'>to be </span> chancellor, and supreme governor of Coelesyria and Phoenicia.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For Ptolemy that was called Macron, setting an example of observing justice toward the Jews because of the wrong that had been done to them, endeavored to <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Or, settle his relations with </span></a> conduct his dealings with them on peaceful terms.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Whereupon being accused by the <span class='add'>king’s </span> <a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> See 2 Maccabees 8:9 </span></a> Friends before Eupator, and hearing himself called traitor at every turn, because he had abandoned Cyprus which Philometor had entrusted to him, and had withdrawn himself to Antiochus <span class='add'>called </span> Epiphanes, and <a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> The Greek text here is corrupt. </span></a> failing to uphold the honor of his office, he took poison and made away with himself. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But Gorgias, when he was made governor of the district, maintained a force of mercenaries, and at every turn kept up war with the Jews.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And together with him the Idumaeans also, being masters of important strongholds, harassed the Jews; and receiving to them those that had taken refuge <span class='add'>there </span> from Jerusalem, they assayed to keep up war.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But Maccabaeus and his men, having made solemn supplication and implored God to fight on their side, rushed upon the strongholds of the Idumaeans;  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>and assaulting them vigorously they made themselves masters of the positions, and kept off all that fought upon the wall, and killed those that fell in their way, and killed no fewer than twenty thousand.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And because no less than nine thousand were fled into two towers exceedingly strong and having all things <span class='add'>needed </span> for a seige,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Maccabaeus, having left Simon and Joseph, and Zacchaeus besides and those who were with him, a force sufficient to besiege them, departed himself to places where he was most needed.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But Simon and those who were with him, yielding to covetousness, were bribed by certain of those that were in the towers, and receiving seventy thousand drachmas let some of them slip away.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But when word was brought to Maccabaeus of what was done, he gathered the leaders of the people together, and accused <span class='add'>those men </span> of having sold their kindred for money, by setting their enemies free <span class='add'>to fight </span> against them.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So he killed these men for having turned traitors, and forthwith took possession of the two towers.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And prospering with his arms in all things he took in hand, he destroyed in the two strongholds more than twenty thousand. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Now Timotheus, who had been before defeated by the Jews, having gathered together foreign forces in great multitudes, and having collected the <a href="#FN9" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Or, horses </span></a> horsemen which belonged to Asia, not a few, came as though he would take Judea by force of arms.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But as he drew near, Maccabaeus and his men sprinkled earth upon their heads and girded their loins with sackcloth, in supplication to God,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>and falling down upon the step in front of the altar, implored him to become <a href="#FN10" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. propitious. </span></a> gracious to them, and <a href="#FN11" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> See Exodus 23:22. </span></a> be an enemy to their enemies and an adversary to their adversaries, as the law declares.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And rising from their prayer they took up their arms, and advanced some distance from the city;
