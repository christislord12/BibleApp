And for that day he held his peace;  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>but having gotten opportunity to further his own madness, being called by Demetrius into a meeting of his council, and asked how the Jews stood affected and what they purposed, he answered thereto.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Those of the Jews that he called <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> That is, Chasidim. </span></a> Hasidaeans, whose leader is Judas Maccabaeus, keep up war, and are seditious, not suffering the kingdom to find tranquillity.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Wherefore, having laid aside my ancestral glory, I mean the high priesthood, I am now come <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Some authorities read a second time. </span></a> here;  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>first for the unfeigned care I have for the things that concern the king, and secondly because I have regard also to my own fellow-citizens: for, through the unadvised dealing of those of whom I spoke before, our whole race is in no small misfortune.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But do you, O king, having informed yourself of these things severally, take thought both for our country and for our race, which <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Or, is hardly bestead </span></a> is surrounded <span class='add'>by foes, </span> according to the gracious kindness with which you receive all.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For as long as Judas remains alive, it is impossible that the state should find peace.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And when he had spoken such words as these, at once <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Or, the king’s Friends likewise </span></a> the rest of the <span class='add'>king’s </span> <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> See 2 Maccabees 8:9. </span></a> Friends, having ill will against Judas, inflamed Demetrius yet more.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And forthwith appointing Nicanor, who had been master of the elephants, and making him governor of Judea, he sent him forth,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>giving him written instructions to make away with Judas himself and to scatter those who were with him, and to set up Alcimus as high priest of the <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. greatest. </span></a> great temple.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And <a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Or, those who had fled before Judas all over Judea thronged </span></a> those in Judea that <a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> See 2 Maccabees 5:27. </span></a> had <span class='add'>before </span> driven Judas into exile thronged to Nicanor in flocks, supposing that the misfortunes and calamities of the Jews would be successes to themselves. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But when <span class='add'>the Jews </span> heard of Nicanor’s inroad and the assault of the heathen, they sprinkled earth <span class='add'>upon their heads </span> and made solemn supplication to him who had established his own people for evermore, and who always, making manifest his presence, upholds <span class='add'>those who are </span> his own portion.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> <a href="#FN9" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> The Greek text of this verse and the next is corrupt. </span></a> And when the leader had given <span class='add'>his </span> commands, he immediately sets out from thence, and joins battle with them at a village <span class='add'>called </span> Lessau.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But Simon, the brother of Judas, had encountered Nicanor, <a href="#FN10" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Or, and had received a check, yet not till late by reason of the sudden consternation of his adversaries </span></a> yet not till late, having received a check by reason of the sudden consternation caused by his adversaries. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Nevertheless Nicanor, hearing of the manliness of those who were with Judas, and their courage in fighting for their country, shrank from bringing the matter to the decision of the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Wherefore he sent Posidonius and Theodotus and Mattathias to give and receive pledges of friendship.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>So when these proposals had been long considered, and the leader had made the <a href="#FN11" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Or, people Gr. multitudes. </span></a> troops acquainted therewith, and it appeared that they were all of like mind, they consented to the covenants.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And they appointed a day on which to meet together by themselves.
