So all the people departed, each to his own house.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then David returned to bless his household. Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, “How glorious the king of Israel was today, who uncovered himself today in the eyes of his servants’ maids, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>David said to Michal, “It was before Yahweh, who chose me above your father, and above all his house, to appoint me prince over the people of Yahweh, over Israel. Therefore I will celebrate before Yahweh.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>I will be yet more vile than this, and will be worthless in my own sight. But the maids of whom you have spoken will honor me.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death. </div><ul class='tnav'>
