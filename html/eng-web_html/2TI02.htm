But God’s word isn’t chained.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones’ sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>This saying is trustworthy: </div><div class='q'>“For if we died with him, </div><div class='q2'>we will also live with him. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>If we endure, </div><div class='q2'>we will also reign with him. </div><div class='q'>If we deny him, </div><div class='q2'>he also will deny us. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>If we are faithless, </div><div class='q2'>he remains faithful; </div><div class='q2'>for he can’t deny himself.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord, that they don’t argue about words, to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who doesn’t need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But shun empty chatter, for it will go further in ungodliness,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>and those words will consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>However God’s firm foundation stands, having this seal, “The Lord knows those who are his,”<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Numbers 16:5</span></a> and, “Let every one who names the name of the Lord<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> TR reads “Christ” instead of “the Lord”</span></a> depart from unrighteousness.”  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay. Some are for honor, and some for dishonor.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master’s use, prepared for every good work. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The Lord’s servant must not quarrel, but be gentle toward all, able to teach, patient,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>in gentleness correcting those who oppose him: perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>and they may recover themselves out of the devil’s snare, having been taken captive by him to his will. </div><ul class='tnav'>
