Turn away from these, also.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For some of these are people who creep into houses and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind, who concerning the faith are rejected.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But they will proceed no further. For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But you followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>persecutions, and sufferings: those things that happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I endured those persecutions. The Lord delivered me out of them all.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>From infancy, you have known the holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith, which is in Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Every Scripture is God-breathed and<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> or, Every writing inspired by God is</span></a> profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>that each person who belongs to God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work. </div><ul class='tnav'>
