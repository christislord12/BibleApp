They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch;  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>whom they set before the apostles. When they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The word of God increased and the number of the disciples greatly multiplied in Jerusalem. A great company of the priests were obedient to the faith. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Stephen, full of faith and power, performed great wonders and signs among the people.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But some of those who were of the synagogue called “The Libertines”, and of the Cyrenians, of the Alexandrians, and of those of Cilicia and Asia arose, disputing with Stephen.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They weren’t able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then they secretly induced men to say, “We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.”  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>They stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes, and came against him and seized him, then brought him in to the council,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>and set up false witnesses who said, “This man never stops speaking blasphemous words against this holy place and the law.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us.”  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>All who sat in the council, fastening their eyes on him, saw his face like it was the face of an angel. </div><ul class='tnav'>
