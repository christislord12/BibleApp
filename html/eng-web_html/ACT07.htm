The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>and said to him, ‘Get out of your land and away from your relatives, and come into a land which I will show you.’<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Genesis 12:1</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then he came out of the land of the Chaldaeans and lived in Haran. From there, when his father was dead, God moved him into this land, where you are now living.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>He gave him no inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on. He promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his offspring after him, when he still had no child.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>God spoke in this way: that his offspring would live as aliens in a strange land, and that they would be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>‘I will judge the nation to which they will be in bondage,’ said God, ‘and after that they will come out, and serve me in this place.’<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Genesis 15:13-14</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>He gave him the covenant of circumcision.

He made him governor over Egypt and all his house.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Now a famine came over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction. Our fathers found no food.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers the first time.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>On the second time Joseph was made known to his brothers, and Joseph’s race was revealed to Pharaoh.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Joseph sent and summoned Jacob, his father, and all his relatives, seventy-five souls.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Jacob went down into Egypt and he died, himself and our fathers,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>and they were brought back to Shechem, and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver from the children of Hamor of Shechem. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>“But as the time of the promise came close which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>until there arose a different king, who didn’t know Joseph.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The same took advantage of our race, and mistreated our fathers, and forced them to throw out their babies, so that they wouldn’t stay alive.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>At that time Moses was born, and was exceedingly handsome.
