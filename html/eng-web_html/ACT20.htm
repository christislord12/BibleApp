As Paul spoke still longer, being weighed down by his sleep, he fell down from the third floor and was taken up dead.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Paul went down and fell upon him, and embracing him said, “Don’t be troubled, for his life is in him.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>When he had gone up, and had broken bread and eaten, and had talked with them a long while, even until break of day, he departed.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>They brought the boy in alive, and were greatly comforted. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But we, going ahead to the ship, set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul aboard there; for he had so arranged, intending himself to go by land.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>When he met us at Assos, we took him aboard, and came to Mitylene.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Sailing from there, we came the following day opposite Chios. The next day we touched at Samos and stayed at Trogyllium, and the day after we came to Miletus.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, that he might not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hastening, if it were possible for him, to be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>From Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called to himself the elders of the assembly.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>When they had come to him, he said to them, “You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I was with you all the time,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>serving the Lord with all humility, with many tears, and with trials which happened to me by the plots of the Jews;  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>how I didn’t shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, teaching you publicly and from house to house,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>testifying both to Jews and to Greeks repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> TR adds “Christ”</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Now, behold, I go bound by the Spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there;  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>except that the Holy Spirit testifies in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions wait for me.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But these things don’t count; nor do I hold my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my race with joy, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to fully testify to the Good News of the grace of God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>“Now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I went about preaching God’s Kingdom, will see my face no more.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Therefore I testify to you today that I am clean from the blood of all men,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>for I didn’t shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Take heed, therefore, to yourselves, and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the assembly of the Lord and <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> TR, NU omit “the Lord and”</span></a> God which he purchased with his own blood.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For I know that after my departure, vicious wolves will enter in among you, not sparing the flock.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Men will arise from among your own selves, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Therefore watch, remembering that for a period of three years I didn’t cease to admonish everyone night and day with tears.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Now, brothers,<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> The word for “brothers” here and where the context allows may also be correctly translated “brothers and sisters” or “siblings.” </span></a> I entrust you to God and to the word of his grace, which is able to build up, and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>I coveted no one’s silver, gold, or clothing.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>You yourselves know that these hands served my necessities, and those who were with me.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>In all things I gave you an example, that so laboring you ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, <span class='wj'>‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’</span>” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>When he had spoken these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>They all wept freely, and fell on Paul’s neck and kissed him,  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>sorrowing most of all because of the word which he had spoken, that they should see his face no more.
