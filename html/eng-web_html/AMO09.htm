I will set my eyes on them for evil, and not for good.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, is he who touches the land and it melts, and all who dwell in it will mourn; and it will rise up wholly like the River, and will sink again, like the River of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>It is he who builds his rooms in the heavens, and has founded his vault on the earth; he who calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out on the surface of the earth; Yahweh is his name.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Are you not like the children of the Ethiopians to me, children of Israel?” says Yahweh. “Haven’t I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Behold, the eyes of the Lord Yahweh are on the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the surface of the earth; except that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>“For, behold, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all the nations, as grain is sifted in a sieve, yet not the least kernel will fall on the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>All the sinners of my people will die by the sword, who say, ‘Evil won’t overtake nor meet us.’  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>In that day I will raise up the tent of David who is fallen, and close up its breaches, and I will raise up its ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old;  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>that they may possess the remnant of Edom, and all the nations who are called by my name,” says Yahweh who does this. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>“Behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, </div><div class='q2'>“that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, </div><div class='q2'>and the one treading grapes him who sows seed; </div><div class='q2'>and sweet wine will drip from the mountains, </div><div class='q2'>and flow from the hills. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I will bring my people Israel back from captivity, </div><div class='q2'>and they will rebuild the ruined cities, and inhabit them; </div><div class='q2'>and they will plant vineyards, and drink wine from them. </div><div class='q'>They shall also make gardens, </div><div class='q2'>and eat their fruit. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>I will plant them on their land, </div><div class='q2'>and they will no more be plucked up out of their land which I have given them,” </div><div class='q2'>says Yahweh your God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
