<div class='mt'>BARUCH </div><div class='ip'>The book of <span class='bk'>Baruch</span> is recognized as Deuterocanonical Scripture by the Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, and Russian Orthodox Churches. In some Bibles, Baruch chapter 6 is listed as a separate book called <span class='bk'>The Letter of Jeremiah</span>, reflecting its separation from Baruch in some copies of the Greek Septuagint.
