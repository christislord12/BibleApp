<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 6</div><div class='s'>The Letter of Jeremy (Jeremiah) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>A copy of an letter, which Jeremy sent to them which were to be led captives into Babylon by the king of the Babylonians, to certify them, as it was commanded him of God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Because of the sins which you° have committed before God, you° shall be led away captives to Babylon by Nabuchodonosor king of the Babylonians.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>So when you° come to Babylon, you° shall remain there many years, and for a long season, even for seven generations: and after that I will bring you out peaceably from thence.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But now shall you° see in Babylon gods of silver, and of gold, and of wood, borne upon shoulders, which cause the nations to fear.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Beware therefore that you° in no wise become like to the strangers, neither let fear take hold upon you because of them, when you° see the multitude before them and behind them, worshiping them.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But say you° in your hearts, O Lord, we must worship you.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For my angel is with you, <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Or, and he cares </span></a> and I myself do care for your <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Or, lives </span></a> souls.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For their tongue is polished by the workman, and they themselves are overlaid with gold and with silver; yet are they but false, and can’t speak.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And taking gold, as it were for a virgin that loves to be happy, they make crowns for the heads of their gods:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>and sometimes also the priests convey from their gods gold and silver, and bestow it upon themselves;  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>and will even give thereof to the common prostitutes: and they deck them as men with garments, <span class='add'>even </span> the gods of silver, and gods of gold, and of wood.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Yet can’t these gods save themselves from rust and moths, though they be covered with purple raiment.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>They wipe their faces because of the dust of the temple, which is thick upon them.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he that can’t put to death one that offends against him holds a sceptre, as though he were judge of a country.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He has also a dagger in his right hand, and an axe: but can’t deliver himself from war and robbers.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Whereby they are known not to be gods: therefore fear them not.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For like as a vessel that a man uses is nothing worth when it is broken; even so it is with their gods: when they be set up in the temples their eyes be full of dust through the feet of those who come in.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And as the courts are made sure on every side upon him that offends the king, as being committed to suffer death; <span class='add'>even so </span> the priests make fast their temples with doors, with locks, and bars, lest they be carried off by robbers.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>They light them candles, yes, more than for themselves, whereof they can’t see one.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>They are as one of the beams of the temple; and men say their hearts are eaten out, when things creeping out of the earth devour both them and their raiment: they feel it not  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>when their faces are blackened through the smoke that comes out of the temple:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>bats, swallows, and birds land on their bodies and heads; and in like manner the cats also.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Whereby you° may know that they are no gods: therefore fear them not.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Notwithstanding the gold wherewith they are beset to make them beautiful, except one wipe off the rust, they will not shine: for not even when they were molten did they feel it.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Things wherein there is no breath are bought at any cost.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Having no feet, they are borne upon shoulders, whereby they declare to men that they be nothing worth.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>They also that serve them are ashamed: for if they fall to the ground at any time, they can’t rise up again of themselves: neither, if they are bowed down, can they make themselves straight: but the offerings are set before them, as if they were dead men.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the things that are sacrificed to them, their priests sell and spend; and in like manner their wives also lay up part thereof in salt; but to the poor and to the impotent they will give nothing thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>The menstruous woman and the woman in childbed touch their sacrifices: knowing therefore by these things that they are no gods, fear them not.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For how can they be called gods? because women set meat before the gods of silver, gold, and wood.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And in their temples the priests <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Or, bear the litter </span></a> sit on seats, having their clothes tore, and their heads and beards shaven, and nothing upon their heads.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>They roar and cry before their gods, as men do at the feast when one is dead.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>The priests also take off garments from them, and clothe their wives and children withal.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Whether it be evil that one does to them, or good, they are not able to recompense it: they can neither set up a king, nor put him down.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>In like manner, they can neither give riches nor money: though a man make a vow to them, and keep it not, they will never exact it.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>They can save no man from death, neither deliver the weak from the mighty.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>They can’t restore a blind man to his sight, nor deliver any that is in distress.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>They can show no mercy to the widow, nor do good to the fatherless.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>They are like the stones that be <span class='add'>hewn </span> out of the mountain, <span class='add'>these gods </span> of wood, and that are overlaid with gold and with silver: those who minister to them shall be confounded.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>How should a man then think or say that they are gods, when even the Chaldeans themselves dishonor them?  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Who if they shall see one mute that can’t speak, they bring him, and entreat him to call upon Bel, as though he were able to understand.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Yet they can’t perceive this themselves, and forsake them: for they have no understanding.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>The women also with cords about them sit in the ways, burning bran for incense: but if any of them, drawn by some that passes by, lie with him, she reproaches her fellow, that she was not thought as worthy as herself, nor her cord broken.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Whatsoever is done among them is false: how should a man then think or say that they are gods?  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>They are fashioned by carpenters and goldsmiths: they can be nothing else than the workmen will have them to be.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And they themselves that fashioned them can never continue long; how then should the things that are fashioned by them?  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>For they have left lies and reproaches to those who come after.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>For when there comes any war or plague upon them, the priests consult with themselves, where they may be hidden with them.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>How then can’t men understand that they be no gods, which can neither save themselves from war, nor from plague?  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>For seeing they be but of wood, and overlaid with gold and with silver, it shall be known hereafter that they are false:  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>and it shall be manifest to all nations and kings that they are no gods, but the works of men’s hands, and that there is no work of God in them.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>Who then may not know that they are no gods?  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>For neither can they set up a king in a land, nor give rain to men.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>Neither can they judge their own cause, nor <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Another reading is, deliver him that is wronged. </span></a> redress a wrong, being unable: for they are as crows between heaven and earth.  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>For even when fire falls upon the house of gods of wood, or overlaid with gold or with silver, their priests will flee away, and escape, but they themselves shall be burned apart like beams.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>Moreover they can’t withstand any king or enemies: how should a man then allow or think that they be gods?  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>Neither are those gods of wood, and overlaid with silver or with gold, able to escape either from thieves or robbers.  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>Whose gold, and silver, and garments wherewith they are clothed, they that are strong will take from them, and go away withal: neither shall they be able to help themselves.  <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>Therefore it is better to be a king that shows his manhood, or else a vessel in a house profitable for that whereof the owner shall have need, than such false gods; or even a door in a house, to keep the things safe that be therein, than such false gods; or a pillar of wood in a palace, than such false gods.  <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>For sun, and moon, and stars, being bright and sent to do their offices, are obedient.  <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>Likewise also the lightning when it glitters is fair to see; and after the same manner the wind also blows in every country.  <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>And when God commands the clouds to go over the whole world, they do as they are told.  <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>And the fire sent from above to consume mountains and woods does as it is commanded: but these are to be likened to them neither in show nor power.  <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#160;</span>Wherefore a man should neither think nor say that they are gods, seeing they are able neither to judge causes, nor to do good to men.  <span class="verse" id="V65">65&#160;</span>Knowing therefore that they are no gods, fear them not.  <span class="verse" id="V66">66&#160;</span>For they can neither curse nor bless kings:  <span class="verse" id="V67">67&#160;</span>neither can they show signs in the heavens among the nations, nor shine as the sun, nor give light as the moon.  <span class="verse" id="V68">68&#160;</span>The beasts are better than they: for they can get under a covert, and help themselves.  <span class="verse" id="V69">69&#160;</span>In no wise then is it manifest to us that they are gods: therefore fear them not.  <span class="verse" id="V70">70&#160;</span>For as a scarecrow in a garden of cucumbers that keeps nothing, so are their gods of wood, and overlaid with gold and with silver.  <span class="verse" id="V71">71&#160;</span>Likewise also their gods of wood, and overlaid with gold and with silver, are like to a white thorn in an orchard, that every bird sits upon; as also to a dead body, that is cast forth into the dark.  <span class="verse" id="V72">72&#160;</span>And you° shall know them to be no gods by the <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. purple and brightness. </span></a> bright purple that rots upon them: And they themselves afterward shall be consumed, and shall be a reproach in the country.  <span class="verse" id="V73">73&#160;</span>Better therefore is the just man that has none idols: for he shall be far from reproach. </div><ul class='tnav'>
