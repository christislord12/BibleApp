At the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be established.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>If an unrighteous witness rises up against any man to testify against him of wrongdoing,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before Yahweh, before the priests and the judges who shall be in those days;  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>and the judges shall make diligent inquisition; and behold, if the witness is a false witness, and has testified falsely against his brother,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>then you shall do to him as he had thought to do to his brother. So you shall remove the evil from among you.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Those who remain shall hear, and fear, and will never again commit any such evil among you.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Your eyes shall not pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot. </div><ul class='tnav'>
