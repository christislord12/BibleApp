She shall shave her head and trim her nails.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>She shall take off the clothing of her captivity, and shall remain in your house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month. After that you shall go in to her and be her husband, and she shall be your wife.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>It shall be, if you have no delight in her, then you shall let her go where she desires; but you shall not sell her at all for money. You shall not deal with her as a slave, because you have humbled her. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>If a man has two wives, the one beloved and the other hated, and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated, and if the firstborn son is hers who was hated,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>then it shall be, in the day that he causes his sons to inherit that which he has, that he may not give the son of the beloved the rights of the firstborn before the son of the hated, who is the firstborn;  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>but he shall acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he has; for he is the beginning of his strength. The right of the firstborn is his. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother, and though they chasten him, will not listen to them,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his city and to the gate of his place.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>They shall tell the elders of his city, “This our son is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey our voice. He is a glutton and a drunkard.”  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>All the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones. So you shall remove the evil from among you. All Israel shall hear, and fear. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>If a man has committed a sin worthy of death, and he is put to death, and you hang him on a tree,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>his body shall not remain all night on the tree, but you shall surely bury him the same day; for he who is hanged is accursed of God. Don’t defile your land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance. </div><ul class='tnav'>
