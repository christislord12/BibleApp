You shall surely bring them again to your brother.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>If your brother isn’t near to you, or if you don’t know him, then you shall bring it home to your house, and it shall be with you until your brother comes looking for it, and you shall restore it to him.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>So you shall do with his donkey. So you shall do with his garment. So you shall do with every lost thing of your brother’s, which he has lost and you have found. You may not hide yourself.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>You shall not see your brother’s donkey or his ox fallen down by the way, and hide yourself from them. You shall surely help him to lift them up again. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>A woman shall not wear men’s clothing, neither shall a man put on women’s clothing; for whoever does these things is an abomination to Yahweh your God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>If you come across a bird’s nest on the way, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs, and the hen sitting on the young, or on the eggs, you shall not take the hen with the young.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>You shall surely let the hen go, but the young you may take for yourself, that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>When you build a new house, then you shall make a railing around your roof, so that you don’t bring blood on your house if anyone falls from there. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>You shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed, lest all the fruit be defiled, the seed which you have sown, and the increase of the vineyard.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>You shall not wear clothes of wool and linen woven together. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>You shall make yourselves fringes<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> or, tassels</span></a> on the four corners of your cloak with which you cover yourself. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>If any man takes a wife, and goes in to her, hates her,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>accuses her of shameful things, gives her a bad name, and says, “I took this woman, and when I came near to her, I didn’t find in her the tokens of virginity;”  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>then the young lady’s father and mother shall take and bring the tokens of the young lady’s virginity to the elders of the city in the gate.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The young lady’s father shall tell the elders, “I gave my daughter to this man as his wife, and he hates her.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Behold, he has accused her of shameful things, saying, ‘I didn’t find in your daughter the tokens of virginity;’ and yet these are the tokens of my daughter’s virginity.” They shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>They shall fine him one hundred shekels of silver,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> A shekel is about 10 grams or about 0.35 ounces, so 100 shekels is about a kilogram or 2.2 pounds.</span></a> and give them to the father of the young lady, because he has given a bad name to a virgin of Israel.
