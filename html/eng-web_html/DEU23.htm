You shall not abhor an Egyptian, because you lived as a foreigner in his land.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The children of the third generation who are born to them may enter into Yahweh’s assembly. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>When you go out and camp against your enemies, then you shall keep yourselves from every evil thing.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>If there is among you any man who is not clean by reason of that which happens to him by night, then shall he go outside of the camp. He shall not come within the camp;  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>but it shall be, when evening comes, he shall bathe himself in water. When the sun is down, he shall come within the camp.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>You shall have a place also outside of the camp where you go relieve yourself.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>You shall have a trowel among your weapons. It shall be, when you relieve yourself, you shall dig with it, and shall turn back and cover your excrement;  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>for Yahweh your God walks in the middle of your camp, to deliver you, and to give up your enemies before you.
