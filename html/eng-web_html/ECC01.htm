It turns around continually as it goes, and the wind returns again to its courses.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full. To the place where the rivers flow, there they flow again.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>All things are full of weariness beyond uttering. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>That which has been is that which shall be; and that which has been done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Is there a thing of which it may be said, “Behold,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> “Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</span></a> this is new?” It has been long ago, in the ages which were before us.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>There is no memory of the former; neither shall there be any memory of the latter that are to come, among those that shall come after. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the sky. It is a heavy burden that God<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).</span></a> has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and behold, all is vanity and a chasing after wind.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>That which is crooked can’t be made straight; and that which is lacking can’t be counted.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I said to myself, “Behold, I have obtained for myself great wisdom above all who were before me in Jerusalem. Yes, my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.”  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also was a chasing after wind.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For in much wisdom is much grief; and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow. </div><ul class='tnav'>
