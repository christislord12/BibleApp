Yes, he pondered, sought out, and set in order many proverbs.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The Preacher sought to find out acceptable words, and that which was written blamelessly, words of truth.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The words of the wise are like goads; and like nails well fastened are words from the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Furthermore, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>This is the end of the matter. All has been heard. Fear God and keep his commandments; for this is the whole duty of man.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For God will bring every work into judgment, with every hidden thing, whether it is good, or whether it is evil. </div><ul class='tnav'>
