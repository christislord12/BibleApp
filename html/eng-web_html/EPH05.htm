For because of these things, the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Therefore don’t be partakers with them.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For you were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord. Walk as children of light,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>proving what is well pleasing to the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Have no fellowship with the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but rather even reprove them.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For it is a shame even to speak of the things which are done by them in secret.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But all things, when they are reproved, are revealed by the light, for everything that reveals is light.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Therefore he says, “Awake, you who sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Therefore watch carefully how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>redeeming the time, because the days are evil.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Therefore don’t be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Don’t be drunken with wine, in which is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs; singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>giving thanks always concerning all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God, even the Father;  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>subjecting yourselves to one another in the fear of Christ. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the assembly, being himself the savior of the body.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But as the assembly is subject to Christ, so let the wives also be to their own husbands in everything. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the assembly, and gave himself up for it;  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>that he might present the assembly to himself gloriously, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without defect.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Even so husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord also does the assembly;  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>because we are members of his body, of his flesh and bones.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>“For this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and will be joined to his wife. The two will become one flesh.”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Genesis 2:24</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>This mystery is great, but I speak concerning Christ and of the assembly.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Nevertheless each of you must also love his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she respects her husband. </div><ul class='tnav'>
