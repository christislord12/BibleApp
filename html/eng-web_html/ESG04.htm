Having rushed forth through the open street of the city, he cried with a loud voice, “A nation that has done no wrong is going to be destroyed!”  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>He came to the king’s gate, and stood; for it was not lawful for him to enter into the palace wearing sackcloth and ashes.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And in every province where the letters were published, there was crying, lamentation, and great mourning on the part of the Jews. They wore sackcloth and ashes.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The queen’s maids and chamberlains went in and told her; and when she had heard what was done, she was disturbed. She sent to clothe Mordecai, and take away his sackcloth; but he refused.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>So Esther called for her chamberlain Hathach, who waited upon her; and she sent to learn the truth from Mordecai.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Mordecai showed him what was done, and the promise which Haman had made the king of ten thousand talents to be paid into the treasury, that he might destroy the Jews.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And he gave him the copy of what was published in Susa concerning their destruction to show to Esther; and told him to charge her to go in and entreat the king, and to beg him for the people. “Remember, he said, the days of your humble condition, how you were nursed by my hand; because Haman who holds the next place to the king has spoken against us for death. Call upon the Lord, and speak to the king concerning us, to deliver us from death.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So Hathach went in and told her all these words.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Esther said to Hathach, “Go to Mordecai, and say,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>‘All the nations of the empire know than any man or woman who goes in to the king into the inner court without being called, that person can’t live; except to whomever the king stretches out his golden sceptre, he shall live. I haven’t been called to go into the king for thirty days.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>So Hathach reported to Mordecai all the words of Esther.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then Mordecai said to Hathach, “Go, and say to her, ‘Esther, don’t say to yourself that you alone will escape in the kingdom, more than all the other Jews.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For if you refuse to listen on this occasion, help and protection will come to the Jews from another place; but you and your father’s house will perish. Who knows if you have been made queen for this occasion?’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Esther sent the man that came to her to Mordecai, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>“Go and assemble the Jews that are in Susa, and all of you fast for me, and don’t eat or drink for three days, night and day. My maidens and I will also fast. Then I will go in to the king contrary to the law, even if I must die.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So Mordecai went and did all that Esther commanded him. <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Note: The part between brackets, i.e. to the end of chap. iv. is not in the Hebrew </span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>[He prayed to the Lord, making mention of all the works of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>He said, “Lord <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> See 3 Kings 8.53. Note. </span></a> God, you are king ruling over all, for all things are in your power, and there is no one who can oppose you in your purpose to save Israel;  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>for you have made the heaven and the earth and every wonderful thing under heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>You are Lord of all, and there is no one who can resist you, Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>You know all things. You know, Lord, that it is not in insolence, nor arrogance, nor love of glory, that I have done this, to refuse to bow down to the arrogant Haman.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For I would gladly have kissed the soles of his feet for the safety of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But I have done this that I might not set the glory of man above the glory of God. I will not worship anyone except you, my Lord, and I will not do these things in arrogance.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And now, O Lord God, the King, the God of Abraham, spare your people, for our enemies are planning our destruction, and they have desired to destroy your ancient inheritance.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Do not overlook your people, whom you have redeemed for yourself out of the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Listen to my prayer. Have mercy on your inheritance and turn our mourning into gladness, that we may live and sing praise to your name, O Lord. Don’t utterly destroy the mouth of those who praise you, O Lord.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>All Israel cried with all their might, for death was before their eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And queen Esther took refuge in the Lord, being taken as it were in the agony of death.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Having taken off her glorious apparel, she put on garments of distress and mourning. Instead of grand perfumes she filled her head with ashes and dung. She greatly brought down her body, and she filled every place of her glad adorning with the her tangled hair.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>She implored the Lord God of Israel, and said, “O my Lord, you alone are our king. Help me. I am destitute, and have no helper but you,  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>for my danger is <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Greek in my hand. </span></a>near at hand.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>I have heard from my birth, in the tribe of my kindred that you, Lord, took Israel out of all the nations, and our fathers out of all their kindred for a perpetual inheritance, and have done for them all that you have said.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And now we have sinned before you, and you have delivered us into the hands of our enemies,  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>because we honored their gods. You are righteous, O Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>But now they have not been content with the bitterness of our slavery, but have laid their hands on the hands of their idols  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>to abolish the decree of your mouth, and utterly to destroy your inheritance, and to stop the mouth of those who praise you, and to extinguish the glory of your house and your alter,  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>and to open the mouth of the Gentiles to <span class='add'>speak</span> the <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Greek virtues. </span></a> praises of vanities, and that a mortal king should be admired forever.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>O Lord, don’t resign your sceptre to them that are not, and don’t let them laugh at our fall, but turn their counsel against themselves, and make an example of him who has <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Greek begun against us. </span></a> begun to injure us.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Remember us, O Lord, manifest yourself in the time of our affliction.
