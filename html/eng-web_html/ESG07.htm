What is your request? What is your petition? It shall be done for you, up to half of my kingdom.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>She answered and said, “If I have found favor in the sight of the king, let my life be granted as my petition, and my people as my request.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For both I and my people are sold for destruction, pillage, and genocide. If both we and our children were sold for male and female slaves, I would not have bothered you, for this <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> see Heb. slanderer </span></a> isn’t worthy of the king’s palace.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The king said, “Who has dared to do this thing?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Esther said, “The enemy is Haman, this wicked man!” </div><div class='p'>Then Haman was troubled before the king and the queen.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The king rose up from the banquet to go into the garden. Haman began to beg the queen for mercy; for he saw that he was in trouble.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The king returned from the garden; and Haman had fallen upon the bed, begging the queen for mercy. The king said, “Will you even assault my wife in my house?” </div><div class='p'>And when Haman heard it, he changed countenance.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Bugathan, one of the chamberlains, said to the king, “Behold, Haman has also prepared a gallows for Mordecai, who spoke concerning the king, and a fifty cubit high gallows has been set up on Haman’s property.” </div><div class='p'>The king said, “Let him be <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Or, impaled. </span></a> hanged on it!”  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So Haman was hanged on the gallows that had been prepared for Mordecai.
