No one could withstand them, because the fear of them had fallen on all the people.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>All the princes of the provinces, the local governors, the governors, and those who did the king’s business helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For Mordecai was great in the king’s house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces; for the man Mordecai grew greater and greater.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The Jews struck all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and with slaughter and destruction, and did what they wanted to those who hated them.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>In the citadel of Susa, the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>They killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jews’ enemy, but they didn’t lay their hand on the plunder. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>On that day, the number of those who were slain in the citadel of Susa was brought before the king.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The king said to Esther the queen, “The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in the citadel of Susa, including the ten sons of Haman; what then have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces! Now what is your petition? It shall be granted you. What is your further request? It shall be done.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then Esther said, “If it pleases the king, let it be granted to the Jews who are in Susa to do tomorrow also according to today’s decree, and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged on the gallows.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The king commanded this to be done.
