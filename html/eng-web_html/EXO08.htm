They shall remain in the river only.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried to Yahweh concerning the frogs which he had brought on Pharaoh.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Yahweh did according to the word of Moses, and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>They gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite, he hardened his heart, and didn’t listen to them, as Yahweh had spoken. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Yahweh said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Stretch out your rod, and strike the dust of the earth, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.’ ”  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>They did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and struck the dust of the earth, and there were lice on man, and on animal; all the dust of the earth became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The magicians tried with their enchantments to produce lice, but they couldn’t. There were lice on man, and on animal.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, “This is God’s finger;” but Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he didn’t listen to them, as Yahweh had spoken. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Yahweh said to Moses, “Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; behold, he comes out to the water; and tell him, ‘This is what Yahweh says, “Let my people go, that they may serve me.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Else, if you will not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies on you, and on your servants, and on your people, and into your houses. The houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground they are on.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>I will set apart in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there, to the end you may know that I am Yahweh on the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>I will put a division between my people and your people. This sign shall happen by tomorrow.” ’ ”  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Yahweh did so; and there came grievous swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants’ houses. In all the land of Egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the swarms of flies. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, “Go, sacrifice to your God in the land!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Moses said, “It isn’t appropriate to do so; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to Yahweh our God. Behold, if we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, won’t they stone us?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>We will go three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Yahweh our God, as he shall command us.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Pharaoh said, “I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to Yahweh your God in the wilderness, only you shall not go very far away. Pray for me.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Moses said, “Behold, I am going out from you. I will pray to Yahweh that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, tomorrow; only don’t let Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to Yahweh.”  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Moses went out from Pharaoh, and prayed to Yahweh.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Yahweh did according to the word of Moses, and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people. There remained not one.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he didn’t let the people go. </div><ul class='tnav'>
