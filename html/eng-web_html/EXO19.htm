Whoever touches the mountain shall be surely put to death.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>No hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through; whether it is animal or man, he shall not live.’ When the trumpet sounds long, they shall come up to the mountain.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Moses went down from the mountain to the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He said to the people, “Be ready by the third day. Don’t have sexual relations with a woman.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>On the third day, when it was morning, there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud on the mountain, and the sound of an exceedingly loud trumpet; and all the people who were in the camp trembled.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Moses led the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the lower part of the mountain.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>All of Mount Sinai smoked, because Yahweh descended on it in fire; and its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked greatly.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>When the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Yahweh came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain. Yahweh called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Yahweh said to Moses, “Go down, warn the people, lest they break through to Yahweh to gaze, and many of them perish.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Let the priests also, who come near to Yahweh, sanctify themselves, lest Yahweh break out on them.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Moses said to Yahweh, “The people can’t come up to Mount Sinai, for you warned us, saying, ‘Set bounds around the mountain, and sanctify it.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Yahweh said to him, “Go down! You shall bring Aaron up with you, but don’t let the priests and the people break through to come up to Yahweh, lest he break out against them.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>So Moses went down to the people, and told them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
