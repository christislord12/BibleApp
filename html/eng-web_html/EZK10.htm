The appearance of the wheels was like a beryl stone.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>As for their appearance, the four of them had one likeness, like a wheel within a wheel.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>When they went, they went in their four directions. They didn’t turn as they went, but to the place where the head looked they followed it. They didn’t turn as they went.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Their whole body, including their backs, their hands, their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes all around, even the wheels that the four of them had.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing, “the whirling wheels”.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Every one them had four faces. The first face was the face of the cherub. The second face was the face of a man. The third face was the face of a lion. The fourth was the face of an eagle. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The cherubim mounted up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river Chebar.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>When the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels also didn’t turn from beside them.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>When they stood, these stood. When they mounted up, these mounted up with them; for the spirit of the living creature was in them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Yahweh’s glory went out from over the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went out, with the wheels beside them. Then they stood at the door of the east gate of Yahweh’s house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Every one had four faces, and every one four wings. The likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>As for the likeness of their faces, they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances and themselves. They each went straight forward. </div><ul class='tnav'>
