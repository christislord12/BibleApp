As I live,” says the Lord Yahweh, “I will not be inquired of by you.” ’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>“Will you judge them, son of man? Will you judge them? Cause them to know the abominations of their fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “In the day when I chose Israel, and swore to the offspring of the house of Jacob, and made myself known to them in the land of Egypt, when I swore to them, saying, ‘I am Yahweh your God;’  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>in that day I swore to them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I said to them, ‘Each of you throw away the abominations of his eyes. Don’t defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I am Yahweh your God.’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>“ ‘ “But they rebelled against me, and would not listen to me. They didn’t all throw away the abominations of their eyes. They also didn’t forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said I would pour out my wrath on them, to accomplish my anger against them in the middle of the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But I worked for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, among which they were, in whose sight I made myself known to them, in bringing them out of the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So I caused them to go out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I gave them my statutes, and showed them my ordinances, which if a man does, he will live in them.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Moreover also I gave them my Sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>“ ‘ “But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness. They didn’t walk in my statutes, and they rejected my ordinances, which if a man keeps, he shall live in them. They greatly profaned my Sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out my wrath on them in the wilderness, to consume them.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But I worked for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Moreover also I swore to them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands;  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>because they rejected my ordinances, and didn’t walk in my statutes, and profaned my Sabbaths; for their heart went after their idols.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Nevertheless my eye spared them, and I didn’t destroy them. I didn’t make a full end of them in the wilderness.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I said to their children in the wilderness, ‘Don’t walk in the statutes of your fathers. Don’t observe their ordinances or defile yourselves with their idols.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>I am Yahweh your God. Walk in my statutes, keep my ordinances, and do them.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Make my Sabbaths holy.

Then I said I would pour out my wrath on them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Nevertheless I withdrew my hand, and worked for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Moreover I swore to them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations, and disperse them through the countries;  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>because they had not executed my ordinances, but had rejected my statutes, and had profaned my Sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers’ idols.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Moreover also I gave them statutes that were not good, and ordinances in which they should not live.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused all that opens the womb to pass through the fire, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am Yahweh.” ’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>“Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Moreover, in this your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For when I had brought them into the land which I swore to give to them, then they saw every high hill, and every thick tree, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering. There they also made their pleasant aroma, and there they poured out their drink offerings.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Then I said to them, ‘What does the high place where you go mean?’ So its name is called Bamah<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> “Bamah” means “High Place”.</span></a> to this day.” ’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>“Therefore tell the house of Israel, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Do you pollute yourselves in the way of your fathers?
