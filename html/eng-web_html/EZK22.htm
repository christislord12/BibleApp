Will you judge the bloody city? Then cause her to know all her abominations.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>You shall say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “A city that sheds blood within herself, that her time may come, and that makes idols against herself to defile her!  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>You have become guilty in your blood that you have shed, and are defiled in your idols which you have made! You have caused your days to draw near, and have come even to your years. Therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations, and a mocking to all the countries.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Those who are near, and those who are far from you, will mock you, you infamous one, full of tumult. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>“ ‘ “Behold, the princes of Israel, everyone according to his power, have been in you to shed blood.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>In you have they treated father and mother with contempt.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Literally, made light of father and mother.</span></a> Among you they have oppressed the foreigner.

In you they have eaten on the mountains. They have committed lewdness among you.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>In you have they uncovered their fathers’ nakedness. In you have they humbled her who was unclean in her impurity.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>One has committed abomination with his neighbor’s wife; and another has lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law. Another in you has humbled his sister, his father’s daughter.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>In you have they taken bribes to shed blood. You have taken interest and increase, and you have greedily gained of your neighbors by oppression, and have forgotten me,” says the Lord Yahweh. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>“ ‘ “Behold, therefore I have struck my hand at your dishonest gain which you have made, and at your blood which has been within you.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Can your heart endure, or can your hands be strong, in the days that I will deal with you? I, Yahweh, have spoken it, and will do it.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>I will scatter you among the nations, and disperse you through the countries.
