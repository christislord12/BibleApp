<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 24</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Again, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>“Son of man, write the name of the day, this same day. The king of Babylon drew close to Jerusalem this same day.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Utter a parable to the rebellious house, and tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says, </div><div class='q'>“Put the cauldron on the fire. </div><div class='q2'>Put it on, </div><div class='q2'>and also pour water into it. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Gather its pieces into it, </div><div class='q2'>even every good piece: </div><div class='q2'>the thigh and the shoulder. </div><div class='q2'>Fill it with the choice bones. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Take the choice of the flock, </div><div class='q2'>and also a pile of wood for the bones under the cauldron. </div><div class='q'>Make it boil well. </div><div class='q2'>Yes, let its bones be boiled within it.” </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>“ ‘Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: </div><div class='q'>“Woe to the bloody city, </div><div class='q2'>to the cauldron whose rust is in it, </div><div class='q2'>and whose rust hasn’t gone out of it! </div><div class='q'>Take out of it piece after piece. </div><div class='q2'>No lot is fallen on it. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>“ ‘ “For her blood is in the middle of her. </div><div class='q2'>She set it on the bare rock. </div><div class='q'>She didn’t pour it on the ground, </div><div class='q2'>to cover it with dust. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance, </div><div class='q2'>I have set her blood on the bare rock, </div><div class='q2'>that it should not be covered.” </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>“ ‘Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: </div><div class='q'>“Woe to the bloody city! </div><div class='q2'>I also will make the pile great. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Heap on the wood. </div><div class='q2'>Make the fire hot. </div><div class='q'>Boil the meat well. </div><div class='q2'>Make the broth thick, </div><div class='q2'>and let the bones be burned. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then set it empty on its coals, </div><div class='q2'>that it may be hot, </div><div class='q'>and its bronze may burn, </div><div class='q2'>and that its filthiness may be molten in it, </div><div class='q2'>that its rust may be consumed. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>She is weary with toil; </div><div class='q2'>yet her great rust, </div><div class='q2'>rust by fire, doesn’t leave her. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>“ ‘ “In your filthiness is lewdness. Because I have cleansed you and you weren’t cleansed, you won’t be cleansed from your filthiness any more, until I have caused my wrath toward you to rest. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I, Yahweh, have spoken it. It will happen, and I will do it. I won’t go back. I won’t spare. I won’t repent. According to your ways, and according to your doings, they will judge you,” says the Lord Yahweh.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Also Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>“Son of man, behold, I will take away from you the desire of your eyes with a stroke: yet you shall neither mourn nor weep, neither shall your tears run down.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Sigh, but not aloud. Make no mourning for the dead. Bind your headdress on you, and put your sandals on your feet. Don’t cover your lips, and don’t eat mourner’s bread.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>So I spoke to the people in the morning; and at evening my wife died. So I did in the morning as I was commanded. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The people asked me, “Won’t you tell us what these things are to us, that you do so?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then I said to them, “Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>‘Speak to the house of Israel, “The Lord Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pities; and your sons and your daughters whom you have left behind will fall by the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>You will do as I have done. You won’t cover your lips or eat mourner’s bread.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Your turbans will be on your heads, and your sandals on your feet. You won’t mourn or weep; but you will pine away in your iniquities, and moan one toward another.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Thus Ezekiel will be a sign to you; according to all that he has done, you will do. When this comes, then you will know that I am the Lord Yahweh.’ ” ’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>“You, son of man, shouldn’t it be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their heart, their sons and their daughters,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>that in that day he who escapes will come to you, to cause you to hear it with your ears?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>In that day your mouth will be opened to him who has escaped, and you will speak, and be no more mute. So you will be a sign to them. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.” </div><ul class='tnav'>
