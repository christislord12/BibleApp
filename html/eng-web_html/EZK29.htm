When they leaned on you, you broke, and paralyzed all of their thighs.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>“ ‘Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: “Behold, I will bring a sword on you, and will cut off man and animal from you.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The land of Egypt will be a desolation and a waste. Then they will know that I am Yahweh. </div><div class='p'>“ ‘ “Because he has said, ‘The river is mine, and I have made it;’  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>therefore, behold, I am against you, and against your rivers. I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation, from the tower of Seveneh even to the border of Ethiopia.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>No foot of man will pass through it, nor will any animal foot pass through it. It won’t be inhabited for forty years.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the middle of the countries that are desolate. Her cities among the cities that are laid waste will be a desolation forty years. I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>“ ‘For the Lord Yahweh says: “At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the peoples where they were scattered.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I will reverse the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their birth. They will be a lowly kingdom, there.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>It will be the lowest of the kingdoms. It won’t lift itself up above the nations any more. I will diminish them, so that they will no longer rule over the nations.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>It will no longer be the confidence of the house of Israel, bringing iniquity to memory, when they turn to look after them. Then they will know that I am the Lord Yahweh.” ’ ” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>It came to pass in the twenty-seventh year, in the first month, in the first day of the month, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>“Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre. Every head was made bald, and every shoulder was worn; yet he had no wages, nor did his army, from Tyre, for the service that he had served against it.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.
