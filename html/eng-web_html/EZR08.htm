The silver and the gold are a free will offering to Yahweh, the God of your fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Watch and keep them, until you weigh them before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites, and the princes of the fathers’ households of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the rooms of Yahweh’s house.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>So the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go to Jerusalem. The hand of our God was on us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and the bandit by the way.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>We came to Jerusalem, and stayed there three days.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>On the fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, the Levite;  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>everything by number and by weight; and all the weight was written at that time. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>The children of the captivity, who had come out of exile, offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel, twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and twelve male goats for a sin offering. All this was a burnt offering to Yahweh.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>They delivered the king’s commissions to the king’s local governors, and to the governors beyond the River. So they supported the people and God’s house. </div><ul class='tnav'>
