<div class='mt'>Paul’s Letter to the Galatians  
</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Paul, an apostle—not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead—  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>and all the brothers<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> The word for “brothers” here and where context allows may also be correctly translated “brothers and sisters” or “siblings.” </span></a> who are with me, to the assemblies of Galatia:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father—  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ to a different “good news”,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>but there isn’t another “good news.” Only there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the Good News of Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But even though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you any “good news” other than that which we preached to you, let him be cursed.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>As we have said before, so I now say again: if any man preaches to you any “good news” other than that which you received, let him be cursed.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? For if I were still pleasing men, I wouldn’t be a servant of Christ. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But I make known to you, brothers, concerning the Good News which was preached by me, that it is not according to man.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For I didn’t receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For you have heard of my way of living in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the assembly of God and ravaged it.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I advanced in the Jews’ religion beyond many of my own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me from my mother’s womb and called me through his grace  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I didn’t immediately confer with flesh and blood,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia. Then I returned to Damascus. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But of the other apostles I saw no one except James, the Lord’s brother.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Now about the things which I write to you, behold,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> “Behold”, from “ἰδοὺ”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at.
