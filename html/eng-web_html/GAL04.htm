You did me no wrong,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>but you know that because of weakness in the flesh I preached the Good News to you the first time.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>That which was a temptation to you in my flesh, you didn’t despise nor reject; but you received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>What was the blessing you enjoyed? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So then, have I become your enemy by telling you the truth?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>They zealously seek you in no good way. No, they desire to alienate you, that you may seek them.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But it is always good to be zealous in a good cause, and not only when I am present with you. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>My little children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ is formed in you—  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>but I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my tone, for I am perplexed about you. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, don’t you listen to the law?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the servant, and one by the free woman.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>However, the son by the servant was born according to the flesh, but the son by the free woman was born through promise.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>These things contain an allegory, for these are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children to bondage, which is Hagar.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and answers to the Jerusalem that exists now, for she is in bondage with her children.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is the mother of us all.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For it is written, </div><div class='q'>“Rejoice, you barren who don’t bear. </div><div class='q2'>Break out and shout, you who don’t travail. </div><div class='q2'>For the desolate have more children than her who has a husband.” <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Isaiah 54:1</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Now we, brothers, as Isaac was, are children of promise.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>But as then, he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>However what does the Scripture say? “Throw out the servant and her son, for the son of the servant will not inherit with the son of the free woman.”<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Genesis 21:10</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>So then, brothers, we are not children of a servant, but of the free woman. </div><ul class='tnav'>
