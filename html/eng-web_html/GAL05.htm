You have fallen away from grace.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For we, through the Spirit, by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision amounts to anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>You were running well! Who interfered with you that you should not obey the truth?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>This persuasion is not from him who calls you.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>A little yeast grows through the whole lump.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I have confidence toward you in the Lord that you will think no other way. But he who troubles you will bear his judgment, whoever he is. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross has been removed.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I wish that those who disturb you would cut themselves off. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For you, brothers, were called for freedom. Only don’t use your freedom for gain to the flesh, but through love be servants to one another.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Leviticus 19:18</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But if you bite and devour one another, be careful that you don’t consume one another. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you won’t fulfill the lust of the flesh.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, that you may not do the things that you desire.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Now the deeds of the flesh are obvious, which are: adultery, sexual immorality, uncleanness, lustfulness,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousies, outbursts of anger, rivalries, divisions, heresies,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>envy, murders, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these; of which I forewarn you, even as I also forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit God’s Kingdom. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> or, faithfulness</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>If we live by the Spirit, let’s also walk by the Spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Let’s not become conceited, provoking one another, and envying one another. </div><ul class='tnav'>
