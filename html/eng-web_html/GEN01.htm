Darkness was on the surface of the deep and God’s Spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>God saw the light, and saw that it was good. God divided the light from the darkness.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>God called the light “day”, and the darkness he called “night”. There was evening and there was morning, the first day. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>God said, “Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.”  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>God made the expanse, and divided the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>God called the expanse “sky”.
