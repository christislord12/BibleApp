He said to the woman, “Has God really said, ‘You shall not eat of any tree of the garden’?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat fruit from the trees of the garden,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>but not the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden. God has said, ‘You shall not eat of it. You shall not touch it, lest you die.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The serpent said to the woman, “You won’t really die,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>for God knows that in the day you eat it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took some of its fruit, and ate. Then she gave some to her husband with her, and he ate it, too.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Their eyes were opened, and they both knew that they were naked. They sewed fig leaves together, and made coverings for themselves.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>They heard Yahweh God’s voice walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the garden. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Yahweh God called to the man, and said to him, “Where are you?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The man said, “I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; so I hid myself.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>God said, “Who told you that you were naked?
