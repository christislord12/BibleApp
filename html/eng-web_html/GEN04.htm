She conceived,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> or, became pregnant</span></a> and gave birth to Cain, and said, “I have gotten a man with Yahweh’s help.”  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Again she gave birth, to Cain’s brother Abel. Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>As time passed, Cain brought an offering to Yahweh from the fruit of the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Abel also brought some of the firstborn of his flock and of its fat. Yahweh respected Abel and his offering,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>but he didn’t respect Cain and his offering. Cain was very angry, and the expression on his face fell.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Yahweh said to Cain, “Why are you angry? Why has the expression of your face fallen?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>If you do well, won’t it be lifted up? If you don’t do well, sin crouches at the door. Its desire is for you, but you are to rule over it.”  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Cain said to Abel, his brother, “Let’s go into the field.” While they were in the field, Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and killed him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Yahweh said to Cain, “Where is Abel, your brother?” </div><div class='p'>He said, “I don’t know. Am I my brother’s keeper?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Yahweh said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood cries to me from the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Now you are cursed because of the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>From now on, when you till the ground, it won’t yield its strength to you. You will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Cain said to Yahweh, “My punishment is greater than I can bear.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Behold, you have driven me out today from the surface of the ground. I will be hidden from your face, and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth. Whoever finds me will kill me.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Yahweh said to him, “Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold.” Yahweh appointed a sign for Cain, so that anyone finding him would not strike him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Cain left Yahweh’s presence, and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Cain knew his wife. She conceived, and gave birth to Enoch. He built a city, and named the city after the name of his son, Enoch.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Irad was born to Enoch. Irad became the father of Mehujael. Mehujael became the father of Methushael. Methushael became the father of Lamech.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Lamech took two wives: the name of the first one was Adah, and the name of the second one was Zillah.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Adah gave birth to Jabal, who was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>His brother’s name was Jubal, who was the father of all who handle the harp and pipe.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Zillah also gave birth to Tubal Cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of bronze and iron. Tubal Cain’s sister was Naamah.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Lamech said to his wives, </div><div class='q'>“Adah and Zillah, hear my voice. </div><div class='q2'>You wives of Lamech, listen to my speech, </div><div class='q'>for I have slain a man for wounding me, </div><div class='q2'>a young man for bruising me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>If Cain will be avenged seven times, </div><div class='q2'>truly Lamech seventy-seven times.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Adam knew his wife again. She gave birth to a son, and named him Seth, saying, “for God has given me another child instead of Abel, for Cain killed him.”  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>A son was also born to Seth, and he named him Enosh. At that time men began to call on Yahweh’s name. </div><ul class='tnav'>
