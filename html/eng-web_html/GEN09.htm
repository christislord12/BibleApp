Everything that moves along the ground, and all the fish of the sea, are delivered into your hand.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Every moving thing that lives will be food for you. As I gave you the green herb, I have given everything to you.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But flesh with its life, that is, its blood, you shall not eat.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>I will surely require accounting for your life’s blood. At the hand of every animal I will require it. At the hand of man, even at the hand of every man’s brother, I will require the life of man.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Whoever sheds man’s blood, his blood will be shed by man, for God made man in his own image.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Be fruitful and multiply. Increase abundantly in the earth, and multiply in it.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>“As for me, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your offspring after you,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>and with every living creature that is with you: the birds, the livestock, and every animal of the earth with you, of all that go out of the ship, even every animal of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I will establish my covenant with you: All flesh will not be cut off any more by the waters of the flood. There will never again be a flood to destroy the earth.”  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>God said, “This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I set my rainbow in the cloud, and it will be a sign of a covenant between me and the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>When I bring a cloud over the earth, that the rainbow will be seen in the cloud,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh, and the waters will no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The rainbow will be in the cloud. I will look at it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.”  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>God said to Noah, “This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The sons of Noah who went out from the ship were Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

He was uncovered within his tent.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it on both their shoulders, went in backwards, and covered the nakedness of their father. Their faces were backwards, and they didn’t see their father’s nakedness.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done to him.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>He said, </div><div class='q'>“Canaan is cursed. </div><div class='q2'>He will be a servant of servants to his brothers.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>He said, </div><div class='q'>“Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Shem. </div><div class='q2'>Let Canaan be his servant. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>May God enlarge Japheth. </div><div class='q2'>Let him dwell in the tents of Shem. </div><div class='q2'>Let Canaan be his servant.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Noah lived three hundred fifty years after the flood.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>All the days of Noah were nine hundred fifty years, and then he died. </div><ul class='tnav'>
