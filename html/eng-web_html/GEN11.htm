Now nothing will be withheld from them, which they intend to do.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Come, let’s go down, and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.”  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>So Yahweh scattered them abroad from there on the surface of all the earth. They stopped building the city.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Therefore its name was called Babel, because there Yahweh confused the language of all the earth. From there, Yahweh scattered them abroad on the surface of all the earth. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>This is the history of the generations of Shem: Shem was one hundred years old when he became the father of Arpachshad two years after the flood.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Shem lived five hundred years after he became the father of Arpachshad, and became the father of more sons and daughters. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Arpachshad lived thirty-five years and became the father of Shelah.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Arpachshad lived four hundred three years after he became the father of Shelah, and became the father of more sons and daughters. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Shelah lived thirty years, and became the father of Eber.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Shelah lived four hundred three years after he became the father of Eber, and became the father of more sons and daughters. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Eber lived thirty-four years, and became the father of Peleg.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Eber lived four hundred thirty years after he became the father of Peleg, and became the father of more sons and daughters. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Peleg lived thirty years, and became the father of Reu.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Peleg lived two hundred nine years after he became the father of Reu, and became the father of more sons and daughters. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Reu lived thirty-two years, and became the father of Serug.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Reu lived two hundred seven years after he became the father of Serug, and became the father of more sons and daughters. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Serug lived thirty years, and became the father of Nahor.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Serug lived two hundred years after he became the father of Nahor, and became the father of more sons and daughters. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and became the father of Terah.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Nahor lived one hundred nineteen years after he became the father of Terah, and became the father of more sons and daughters. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Terah lived seventy years, and became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Now this is the history of the generations of Terah.
