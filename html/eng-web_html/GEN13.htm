There Abram called on Yahweh’s name.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, herds, and tents.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The land was not able to bear them, that they might live together; for their possessions were so great that they couldn’t live together.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>There was strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock. The Canaanites and the Perizzites lived in the land at that time.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Abram said to Lot, “Please, let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen; for we are relatives.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Isn’t the whole land before you? Please separate yourself from me. If you go to the left hand, then I will go to the right. Or if you go to the right hand, then I will go to the left.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Lot lifted up his eyes, and saw all the plain of the Jordan, that it was well-watered everywhere, before Yahweh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of Yahweh, like the land of Egypt, as you go to Zoar.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>So Lot chose the Plain of the Jordan for himself. Lot traveled east, and they separated themselves from one other.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Abram lived in the land of Canaan, and Lot lived in the cities of the plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Now the men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinners against Yahweh. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Yahweh said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him, “Now, lift up your eyes, and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>for I will give all the land which you see to you and to your offspring forever.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if a man can count the dust of the earth, then your offspring may also be counted.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Arise, walk through the land in its length and in its width; for I will give it to you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Abram moved his tent, and came and lived by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built an altar there to Yahweh. </div><ul class='tnav'>
