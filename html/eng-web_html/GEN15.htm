They will afflict them four hundred years.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I will also judge that nation, whom they will serve. Afterward they will come out with great wealth;  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>but you will go to your fathers in peace. You will be buried at a good old age.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>In the fourth generation they will come here again, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full.”  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>It came to pass that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace and a flaming torch passed between these pieces.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>In that day Yahweh made a covenant with Abram, saying, “I have given this land to your offspring, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.” </div><ul class='tnav'>
