It may be that I will obtain children by her.” Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Sarai, Abram’s wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her servant, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>He went in to Hagar, and she conceived. When she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Sarai said to Abram, “This wrong is your fault. I gave my servant into your bosom, and when she saw that she had conceived, she despised me. May Yahweh judge between me and you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But Abram said to Sarai, “Behold, your maid is in your hand.
