The sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>but Abraham gave gifts to the sons of Abraham’s concubines. While he still lived, he sent them away from Isaac his son, eastward, to the east country.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>These are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived: one hundred seventy-five years.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Abraham gave up his spirit, and died at a good old age, an old man, and full of years, and was gathered to his people.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Isaac and Ishmael, his sons, buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron, the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is near Mamre,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>the field which Abraham purchased from the children of Heth. Abraham was buried there with Sarah, his wife.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>After the death of Abraham, God blessed Isaac, his son. Isaac lived by Beer Lahai Roi. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Now this is the history of the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s servant, bore to Abraham.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to the order of their birth: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Mishma, Dumah, Massa,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments: twelve princes, according to their nations.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>These are the years of the life of Ishmael: one hundred thirty-seven years. He gave up his spirit and died, and was gathered to his people.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>They lived from Havilah to Shur that is before Egypt, as you go toward Assyria. He lived opposite all his relatives. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>This is the history of the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son. Abraham became the father of Isaac.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan Aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Isaac entreated Yahweh for his wife, because she was barren. Yahweh was entreated by him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The children struggled together within her. She said, “If it is like this, why do I live?” She went to inquire of Yahweh.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Yahweh said to her, </div><div class='q'>“Two nations are in your womb. </div><div class='q'>Two peoples will be separated from your body. </div><div class='q'>The one people will be stronger than the other people. </div><div class='q'>The elder will serve the younger.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The first came out red all over, like a hairy garment. They named him Esau.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>After that, his brother came out, and his hand had hold on Esau’s heel. He was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The boys grew. Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field. Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Now Isaac loved Esau, because he ate his venison. Rebekah loved Jacob.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Jacob boiled stew. Esau came in from the field, and he was famished.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Esau said to Jacob, “Please feed me with some of that red stew, for I am famished.” Therefore his name was called Edom.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> “Edom” means “red”.</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Jacob said, “First, sell me your birthright.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Esau said, “Behold, I am about to die.
