I cry out to you “Violence!” and will you not save?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Why do you show me iniquity, and look at perversity? For destruction and violence are before me. There is strife, and contention rises up.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Therefore the law is paralyzed, and justice never prevails; for the wicked surround the righteous; therefore justice comes out perverted. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>“Look among the nations, watch, and wonder marvelously; for I am working a work in your days, which you will not believe though it is told you.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For, behold,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> “Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at.

Their judgment and their dignity proceed from themselves.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Their horses also are swifter than leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves. Their horsemen press proudly on. Yes, their horsemen come from afar. They fly as an eagle that hurries to devour.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>All of them come for violence. Their hordes face the desert. He gathers prisoners like sand.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Yes, he scoffs at kings, and princes are a derision to him. He laughs at every stronghold, for he builds up an earthen ramp, and takes it.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then he sweeps by like the wind, and goes on.

We will not die. Yahweh, you have appointed him for judgment. You, Rock, have established him to punish.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>You who have purer eyes than to see evil, and who cannot look on perversity, why do you tolerate those who deal treacherously, and keep silent when the wicked swallows up the man who is more righteous than he,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>and make men like the fish of the sea, like the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He takes up all of them with the hook.
