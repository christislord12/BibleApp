How do you see it now? Isn’t it in your eyes as nothing?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Yet now be strong, Zerubbabel,’ says Yahweh. ‘Be strong, Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land,’ says Yahweh, ‘and work, for I am with you,’ says Yahweh of Armies.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>This is the word that I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt, and my Spirit lived among you. ‘Don’t be afraid.’  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For this is what Yahweh of Armies says: ‘Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, the earth, the sea, and the dry land;  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>and I will shake all nations. The precious things of all nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory, says Yahweh of Armies.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The silver is mine, and the gold is mine,’ says Yahweh of Armies.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>‘The latter glory of this house will be greater than the former,’ says Yahweh of Armies; ‘and in this place I will give peace,’ says Yahweh of Armies.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>In the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, Yahweh’s word came by Haggai the prophet, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>“Yahweh of Armies says: Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>‘If someone carries holy meat in the fold of his garment, and with his fold touches bread, stew, wine, oil, or any food, will it become holy?’ ” </div><div class='p'>The priests answered, “No.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then Haggai said, “If one who is unclean by reason of a dead body touch any of these, will it be unclean?” </div><div class='p'>The priests answered, “It will be unclean.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then Haggai answered, “ ‘So is this people, and so is this nation before me,’ says Yahweh; ‘and so is every work of their hands. That which they offer there is unclean.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Now, please consider from this day and backward, before a stone was laid on a stone in Yahweh’s temple.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Through all that time, when one came to a heap of twenty measures, there were only ten. When one came to the wine vat to draw out fifty, there were only twenty.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>I struck you with blight, mildew, and hail in all the work of your hands; yet you didn’t turn to me,’ says Yahweh.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>‘Consider, please, from this day and backward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, since the day that the foundation of Yahweh’s temple was laid, consider it.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Is the seed yet in the barn? Yes, the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree haven’t produced. From today I will bless you.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Yahweh’s word came the second time to Haggai in the twenty-fourth day of the month, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>“Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, ‘I will shake the heavens and the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms.
