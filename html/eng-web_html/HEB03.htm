We are his house, if we hold fast our confidence and the glorying of our hope firm to the end.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit says, </div><div class='q'>“Today if you will hear his voice, </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>don’t harden your hearts, as in the rebellion, </div><div class='q2'>like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness, </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>where your fathers tested me and tried me, </div><div class='q2'>and saw my deeds for forty years. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Therefore I was displeased with that generation, </div><div class='q2'>and said, ‘They always err in their heart, </div><div class='q2'>but they didn’t know my ways.’ </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>As I swore in my wrath, </div><div class='q2'>‘They will not enter into my rest.’ ”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Psalm 95:7-11</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Beware, brothers, lest perhaps there might be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God;  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called “today”, lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence firm to the end,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>while it is said, </div><div class='q'>“Today if you will hear his voice, </div><div class='q2'>don’t harden your hearts, as in the rebellion.”<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Psalm 95:7-8</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For who, when they heard, rebelled?

Wasn’t it with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>To whom did he swear that they wouldn’t enter into his rest, but to those who were disobedient?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>We see that they weren’t able to enter in because of unbelief. </div><ul class='tnav'>
