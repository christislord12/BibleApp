Don’t be afraid, neither let your heart be faint because of these two tails of smoking torches, for the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have plotted evil against you, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>“Let’s go up against Judah, and tear it apart, and let’s divide it among ourselves, and set up a king within it, even the son of Tabeel.”  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>This is what the Lord Yahweh says: “It shall not stand, neither shall it happen.”  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin. Within sixty-five years Ephraim shall be broken in pieces, so that it shall not be a people.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah’s son. If you will not believe, surely you shall not be established.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Yahweh spoke again to Ahaz, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>“Ask a sign of Yahweh your God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But Ahaz said, “I won’t ask.
