<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 21</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>The burden of the wilderness of the sea. </div><div class='p'>As whirlwinds in the South sweep through, it comes from the wilderness, from an awesome land.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>A grievous vision is declared to me. The treacherous man deals treacherously, and the destroyer destroys. Go up, Elam; attack! I have stopped all of Media’s sighing.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Therefore my thighs are filled with anguish. Pains have seized me, like the pains of a woman in labor. I am in so much pain that I can’t hear. I so am dismayed that I can’t see.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>My heart flutters. Horror has frightened me. The twilight that I desired has been turned into trembling for me.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>They prepare the table. They set the watch. They eat. They drink. Rise up, you princes, oil the shield!  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For the Lord said to me, “Go, set a watchman. Let him declare what he sees.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>When he sees a troop, horsemen in pairs, a troop of donkeys, a troop of camels, he shall listen diligently with great attentiveness.”  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>He cried like a lion: “Lord, I stand continually on the watchtower in the daytime, and every night I stay at my post.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Behold, here comes a troop of men, horsemen in pairs.” He answered, “Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the engraved images of her gods are broken to the ground. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>You are my threshing, and the grain of my floor!” That which I have heard from Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, I have declared to you. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The burden of Dumah. </div><div class='p'>One calls to me out of Seir, “Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?”  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The watchman said, “The morning comes, and also the night. If you will inquire, inquire. Come back again.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The burden on Arabia. </div><div class='p'>In the forest in Arabia you will lodge, you caravans of Dedanites.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>They brought water to him who was thirsty. The inhabitants of the land of Tema met the fugitives with their bread.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For they fled away from the swords, from the drawn sword, from the bent bow, and from the heat of battle.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For the Lord said to me, “Within a year, as a worker bound by contract would count it, all the glory of Kedar will fail,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>and the residue of the number of the archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, will be few; for Yahweh, the God of Israel, has spoken it.” </div><ul class='tnav'>
