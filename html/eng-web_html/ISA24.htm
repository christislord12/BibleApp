<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 24</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Behold, Yahweh makes the earth empty, makes it waste, turns it upside down, and scatters its inhabitants.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>It will be as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the creditor, so with the debtor; as with the taker of interest, so with the giver of interest.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The earth will be utterly emptied and utterly laid waste; for Yahweh has spoken this word.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The earth mourns and fades away. The world languishes and fades away. The lofty people of the earth languish.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The earth also is polluted under its inhabitants, because they have transgressed the laws, violated the statutes, and broken the everlasting covenant.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Therefore the curse has devoured the earth, and those who dwell therein are found guilty. Therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men are left.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The new wine mourns. The vine languishes. All the merry-hearted sigh.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The mirth of tambourines ceases. The sound of those who rejoice ends. The joy of the harp ceases.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>They will not drink wine with a song. Strong drink will be bitter to those who drink it.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The confused city is broken down. Every house is shut up, that no man may come in.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>There is a crying in the streets because of the wine. All joy is darkened. The mirth of the land is gone.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The city is left in desolation, and the gate is struck with destruction.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For it will be so within the earth among the peoples, as the shaking of an olive tree, as the gleanings when the vintage is done. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>These shall lift up their voice. They will shout for the majesty of Yahweh. They cry aloud from the sea.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Therefore glorify Yahweh in the east, even the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel, in the islands of the sea!  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs. Glory to the righteous! </div><div class='p'>But I said, “I pine away! I pine away! woe is me!” The treacherous have dealt treacherously. Yes, the treacherous have dealt very treacherously.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Fear, the pit, and the snare, are on you who inhabit the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>It will happen that he who flees from the noise of the fear will fall into the pit; and he who comes up out of the middle of the pit will be taken in the snare; for the windows on high are opened, and the foundations of the earth tremble.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The earth is utterly broken. The earth is torn apart. The earth is shaken violently.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The earth will stagger like a drunken man, and will sway back and forth like a hammock. Its disobedience will be heavy on it, and it will fall and not rise again. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>It will happen in that day that Yahweh will punish the army of the high ones on high, and the kings of the earth on the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>They will be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and will be shut up in the prison; and after many days they will be visited.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then the moon will be confounded, and the sun ashamed; for Yahweh of Armies will reign on Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem; and glory will be before his elders. </div><ul class='tnav'>
