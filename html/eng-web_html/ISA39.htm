There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah didn’t show them.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then Isaiah the prophet came to king Hezekiah, and asked him, “What did these men say? From where did they come to you?” </div><div class='p'>Hezekiah said, “They have come from a country far from me, even from Babylon.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then he asked, “What have they seen in your house?” </div><div class='p'>Hezekiah answered, “They have seen all that is in my house.

Nothing will be left,’ says Yahweh.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>‘They will take away your sons who will issue from you, whom you shall father, and they will be eunuchs in the king of Babylon’s palace.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “Yahweh’s word which you have spoken is good.” He said moreover, “For there will be peace and truth in my days.” </div><ul class='tnav'>
