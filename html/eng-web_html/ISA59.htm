</div><div class='q2'>and that which is crushed breaks out into a viper. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Their webs won’t become garments. </div><div class='q2'>They won’t cover themselves with their works. </div><div class='q'>Their works are works of iniquity, </div><div class='q2'>and acts of violence are in their hands. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Their feet run to evil, </div><div class='q2'>and they hurry to shed innocent blood. </div><div class='q'>Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity. </div><div class='q2'>Desolation and destruction are in their paths. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>They don’t know the way of peace; </div><div class='q2'>and there is no justice in their ways. </div><div class='q'>They have made crooked paths for themselves; </div><div class='q2'>whoever goes in them doesn’t know peace. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Therefore justice is far from us, </div><div class='q2'>and righteousness doesn’t overtake us. </div><div class='q'>We look for light, but see darkness; </div><div class='q2'>for brightness, but we walk in obscurity. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>We grope for the wall like the blind. </div><div class='q2'>Yes, we grope as those who have no eyes. </div><div class='q'>We stumble at noon as if it were twilight. </div><div class='q2'>Among those who are strong, we are like dead men. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>We all roar like bears </div><div class='q2'>and moan bitterly like doves. </div><div class='q'>We look for justice, but there is none, </div><div class='q2'>for salvation, but it is far off from us. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For our transgressions are multiplied before you, </div><div class='q2'>and our sins testify against us; </div><div class='q'>for our transgressions are with us, </div><div class='q2'>and as for our iniquities, we know them: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>transgressing and denying Yahweh, </div><div class='q2'>and turning away from following our God, </div><div class='q2'>speaking oppression and revolt, </div><div class='q2'>conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Justice is turned away backward, </div><div class='q2'>and righteousness stands far away; </div><div class='q'>for truth has fallen in the street, </div><div class='q2'>and uprightness can’t enter. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Yes, truth is lacking; </div><div class='q2'>and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>Yahweh saw it, </div><div class='q2'>and it displeased him that there was no justice. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He saw that there was no man, </div><div class='q2'>and wondered that there was no intercessor. </div><div class='q'>Therefore his own arm brought salvation to him; </div><div class='q2'>and his righteousness sustained him. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He put on righteousness as a breastplate, </div><div class='q2'>and a helmet of salvation on his head. </div><div class='q'>He put on garments of vengeance for clothing, </div><div class='q2'>and was clad with zeal as a mantle. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>According to their deeds, </div><div class='q2'>he will repay as appropriate, </div><div class='q2'>wrath to his adversaries, </div><div class='q2'>recompense to his enemies; </div><div class='q2'>he will repay the islands their due. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>So they will fear Yahweh’s name from the west, </div><div class='q2'>and his glory from the rising of the sun; </div><div class='q'>for he will come as a rushing stream, </div><div class='q2'>which Yahweh’s breath drives. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>“A Redeemer will come to Zion, </div><div class='q2'>and to those who turn from disobedience in Jacob,” says Yahweh. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>“As for me, this is my covenant with them,” says Yahweh. “My Spirit who is on you, and my words which I have put in your mouth shall not depart out of your mouth, nor out of the mouth of your offspring, nor out of the mouth of your offspring’s offspring,” says Yahweh, “from now on and forever.” </div><ul class='tnav'>
