</div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>a people who provoke me to my face continually, </div><div class='q2'>sacrificing in gardens, </div><div class='q2'>and burning incense on bricks; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>who sit among the graves, </div><div class='q2'>and spend nights in secret places; </div><div class='q'>who eat pig’s meat, </div><div class='q2'>and broth of abominable things is in their vessels; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>who say, ‘Stay by yourself, </div><div class='q2'>don’t come near to me, </div><div class='q2'>for I am holier than you.’ </div><div class='q'>These are smoke in my nose, </div><div class='q2'>a fire that burns all day. </div><div class='b'> &#160;
