<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 2</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>My brothers, don’t hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory with partiality.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>For if a man with a gold ring, in fine clothing, comes into your synagogue,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> or, meeting</span></a> and a poor man in filthy clothing also comes in,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>and you pay special attention to him who wears the fine clothing and say, “Sit here in a good place;” and you tell the poor man, “Stand there,” or “Sit by my footstool”  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>haven’t you shown partiality among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Listen, my beloved brothers. Didn’t God choose those who are poor in this world to be rich in faith, and heirs of the Kingdom which he promised to those who love him?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But you have dishonored the poor man. Don’t the rich oppress you, and personally drag you before the courts?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Don’t they blaspheme the honorable name by which you are called?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>However, if you fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,”<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Leviticus 19:18</span></a> you do well.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But if you show partiality, you commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For whoever keeps the whole law, and yet stumbles in one point, he has become guilty of all.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For he who said, “Do not commit adultery,”<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Exodus 20:14; Deuteronomy 5:18</span></a> also said, “Do not commit murder.”<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Exodus 20:13; Deuteronomy 5:17 </span></a> Now if you do not commit adultery, but murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>So speak and so do, as men who are to be judged by a law of freedom.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>What good is it, my brothers, if a man says he has faith, but has no works? Can faith save him?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And if a brother or sister is naked and in lack of daily food,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>and one of you tells them, “Go in peace. Be warmed and filled;” yet you didn’t give them the things the body needs, what good is it?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead in itself.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Yes, a man will say, “You have faith, and I have works.” Show me your faith without works, and I will show you my faith by my works. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>You believe that God is one. You do well. The demons also believe, and shudder.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But do you want to know, vain man, that faith apart from works is dead?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Wasn’t Abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>You see that faith worked with his works, and by works faith was perfected.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>So the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness,”<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Genesis 15:6</span></a> and he was called the friend of God.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>You see then that by works, a man is justified, and not only by faith.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>In the same way, wasn’t Rahab the prostitute also justified by works, in that she received the messengers and sent them out another way?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead. </div><ul class='tnav'>
