Don’t they come from your pleasures that war in your members?  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>You lust, and don’t have. You murder and covet, and can’t obtain. You fight and make war. You don’t have, because you don’t ask.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>You ask, and don’t receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it on your pleasures.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>You adulterers and adulteresses, don’t you know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, “The Spirit who lives in us yearns jealously”?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, “God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Proverbs 3:34</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Be subject therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners. Purify your hearts, you double-minded.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Lament, mourn, and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to gloom.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Don’t speak against one another, brothers. He who speaks against a brother and judges his brother, speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Only one is the lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge another? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow let’s go into this city, and spend a year there, trade, and make a profit.”  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Whereas you don’t know what your life will be like tomorrow. For what is your life? For you are a vapor that appears for a little time, and then vanishes away.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For you ought to say, “If the Lord wills, we will both live, and do this or that.”  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But now you glory in your boasting. All such boasting is evil.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>To him therefore who knows to do good, and doesn’t do it, to him it is sin. </div><ul class='tnav'>
