Use us as it is pleasing in your sight.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Behold, our dwellings, and all our country, and all our fields of wheat, and our flocks and herds, and all the sheepfolds of our tents, lie before your face.

It had been given to him to destroy all the gods of the land, that all the nations would worship Nebuchadnezzar only, and that all their tongues and their tribes would call upon him as god.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then he came toward Esdraelon near to Dotaea, which is opposite the great ridge of Judea.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He encamped between Geba and Scythopolis.
