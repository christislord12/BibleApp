They put sackcloth around the altar.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>They cried to the God of Israel earnestly with one consent, that he would not give their children as prey, their wives as plunder, the cities of their inheritance to destruction, and the sanctuary to being profaned and being made a reproach, for the nations to rejoice at.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The Lord heard their voice, and looked at their affliction. The people continued fasting many days in all Judea and Jerusalem before the sanctuary of the Lord Almighty.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Joakim the high priest, and all the priests that stood before the Lord, and those who ministered to the Lord, had their loins dressed in sackcloth, and offered the continual burnt offering, the vows, and the free gifts of the people.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>They had ashes on their hats. They cried to the Lord with all their power, that he would look upon all the house of Israel for good. </div><ul class='tnav'>
