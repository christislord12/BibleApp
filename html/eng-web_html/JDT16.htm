When the people were purified, they offered their whole burnt offerings, their free will offerings, and their gifts.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Judith dedicated all Holofernes’ stuff, which the people had given her, and gave the canopy, which she had taken for herself out of his bedchamber, for a gift to the Lord. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the people continued feasting in Jerusalem before the sanctuary for three months, and Judith remained with them.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But after these days, everyone departed to his own inheritance. Judith went away to Bethulia, and remained in her own possession, and was honorable in her time in all the land.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Many desired her, and no man knew her all the days of her life, from the day that Manasses her husband died and was gathered to his people.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>She increased in greatness exceedingly; and she grew old in her husband’s house, to one hundred five years, and let her maid go free. Then she died in Bethulia. They buried her in the cave of her husband Manasses.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The house of Israel mourned for her seven days. She distributed her goods before she died to all those who were nearest of kin to Manasses her husband, and to those who were nearest of her own kindred.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>There was no one that made the children of Israel afraid any more in the days of Judith, nor a long time after her death. </div><ul class='tnav'>
