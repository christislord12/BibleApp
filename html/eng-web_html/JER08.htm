They will not be gathered or be buried. They will be like dung on the surface of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Death will be chosen rather than life by all the residue that remain of this evil family, that remain in all the places where I have driven them,” says Yahweh of Armies.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>“Moreover you shall tell them, ‘Yahweh says: </div><div class='q'>“ ‘Do men fall, and not rise up again?
