Therefore I brought on them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they didn’t do them.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Yahweh said to me, “A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words. They have gone after other gods to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Therefore Yahweh says, ‘Behold, I will bring evil on them, which they will not be able to escape; and they will cry to me, but I will not listen to them.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry to the gods to which they offer incense, but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For according to the number of your cities are your gods, Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have you set up altars to the shameful thing, even altars to burn incense to Baal.’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>“Therefore don’t pray for this people. Don’t lift up cry or prayer for them; for I will not hear them in the time that they cry to me because of their trouble. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>What has my beloved to do in my house, </div><div class='q2'>since she has behaved lewdly with many, </div><div class='q2'>and the holy flesh has passed from you? </div><div class='q'>When you do evil, </div><div class='q2'>then you rejoice.” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Yahweh called your name, “A green olive tree, </div><div class='q2'>beautiful with goodly fruit.” </div><div class='q'>With the noise of a great roar he has kindled fire on it, </div><div class='q2'>and its branches are broken. </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For Yahweh of Armies, who planted you, has pronounced evil against you, because of the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done to themselves in provoking me to anger by offering incense to Baal. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Yahweh gave me knowledge of it, and I knew it. Then you showed me their doings.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But I was like a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter. I didn’t know that they had devised plans against me, saying, </div><div class='q'>“Let’s destroy the tree with its fruit, </div><div class='q2'>and let’s cut him off from the land of the living, </div><div class='q2'>that his name may be no more remembered.” </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But, Yahweh of Armies, who judges righteously, </div><div class='q2'>who tests the heart and the mind, </div><div class='q'>I will see your vengeance on them; </div><div class='q2'>for to you I have revealed my cause. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>“Therefore Yahweh says concerning the men of Anathoth, who seek your life, saying, ‘You shall not prophesy in Yahweh’s name, that you not die by our hand;’  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>therefore Yahweh of Armies says, ‘Behold, I will punish them. The young men will die by the sword. Their sons and their daughters will die by famine.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>There will be no remnant to them, for I will bring evil on the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation.’ ” </div><ul class='tnav'>
