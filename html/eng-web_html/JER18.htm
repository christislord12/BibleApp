Everyone return from his evil way now, and amend your ways and your doings.” ’  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But they say, ‘It is in vain; for we will walk after our own plans, and we will each follow the stubbornness of his evil heart.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Therefore Yahweh says: </div><div class='q'>“Ask now among the nations, </div><div class='q2'>‘Who has heard such things?’ </div><div class='q2'>The virgin of Israel has done a very horrible thing. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Will the snow of Lebanon fail from the rock of the field? </div><div class='q2'>Will the cold waters that flow down from afar be dried up? </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For my people have forgotten me. </div><div class='q2'>They have burned incense to false gods. </div><div class='q'>They have been made to stumble in their ways, </div><div class='q2'>in the ancient paths, </div><div class='q2'>to walk in byways, in a way not built up, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>to make their land an astonishment, </div><div class='q2'>and a perpetual hissing. </div><div class='q'>Everyone who passes by it will be astonished, </div><div class='q2'>and shake his head. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy. </div><div class='q2'>I will show them the back, and not the face, </div><div class='q2'>in the day of their calamity. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then they said, “Come! Let’s devise plans against Jeremiah; for the law won’t perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let’s strike him with the tongue, and let’s not give heed to any of his words.” </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Give heed to me, Yahweh, </div><div class='q2'>and listen to the voice of those who contend with me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Should evil be recompensed for good? </div><div class='q2'>For they have dug a pit for my soul. </div><div class='q'>Remember how I stood before you to speak good for them, </div><div class='q2'>to turn away your wrath from them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, </div><div class='q2'>and give them over to the power of the sword. </div><div class='q'>Let their wives become childless and widows. </div><div class='q2'>Let their men be killed </div><div class='q2'>and their young men struck by the sword in battle. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Let a cry be heard from their houses </div><div class='q2'>when you bring a troop suddenly on them; </div><div class='q'>for they have dug a pit to take me </div><div class='q2'>and hidden snares for my feet. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Yet, Yahweh, you know all their counsel against me to kill me. </div><div class='q2'>Don’t forgive their iniquity. </div><div class='q2'>Don’t blot out their sin from your sight, </div><div class='q'>Let them be overthrown before you. </div><div class='q2'>Deal with them in the time of your anger. </div><ul class='tnav'>
