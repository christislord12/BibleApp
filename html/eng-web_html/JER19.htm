I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hand of those who seek their life. I will give their dead bodies to be food for the birds of the sky and for the animals of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I will make this city an astonishment and a hissing. Everyone who passes by it will be astonished and hiss because of all its plagues.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters. They will each eat the flesh of his friend in the siege and in the distress, with which their enemies, and those who seek their life, will distress them.” ’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>“Then you shall break the container in the sight of the men who go with you,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>and shall tell them, ‘Yahweh of Armies says: “Even so I will break this people and this city, as one breaks a potter’s vessel, that can’t be made whole again. They will bury in Topheth, until there is no place to bury.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>This is what I will do to this place,” says Yahweh, “and to its inhabitants, even making this city as Topheth.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, which are defiled, will be as the place of Topheth, even all the houses on whose roofs they have burned incense to all the army of the sky and have poured out drink offerings to other gods.” ’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then Jeremiah came from Topheth, where Yahweh had sent him to prophesy, and he stood in the court of Yahweh’s house, and said to all the people:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>“Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says, ‘Behold, I will bring on this city and on all its towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it, because they have made their neck stiff, that they may not hear my words.’ ” </div><ul class='tnav'>
