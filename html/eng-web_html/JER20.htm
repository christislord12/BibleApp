Then Jeremiah said to him, “Yahweh has not called your name Pashhur, but Magormissabib.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> “Magormissabib” means “surrounded by terror”</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For Yahweh says, ‘Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends. They will fall by the sword of their enemies, and your eyes will see it. I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will carry them captive to Babylon, and will kill them with the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Moreover I will give all the riches of this city, and all its gains, and all its precious things, yes, I will give all the treasures of the kings of Judah into the hand of their enemies. They will make them captives, take them, and carry them to Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>You, Pashhur, and all who dwell in your house will go into captivity.
