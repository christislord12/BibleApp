Perhaps Yahweh will deal with us according to all his wondrous works, that he may withdraw from us.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then Jeremiah said to them, “Tell Zedekiah:  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>‘Yahweh, the God of Israel says, “Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, with which you fight against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans who besiege you outside the walls; and I will gather them into the middle of this city.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, in wrath, and in great indignation.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I will strike the inhabitants of this city, both man and animal. They will die of a great pestilence.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Afterward,” says Yahweh, “I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, his servants, and the people, even those who are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their life.
