Do no wrong. Do no violence to the foreigner, the fatherless, or the widow. Don’t shed innocent blood in this place.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For if you do this thing indeed, then kings sitting on David’s throne will enter in by the gates of this house, riding in chariots and on horses, he, his servants, and his people.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But if you will not hear these words, I swear by myself,” says Yahweh, “that this house will become a desolation.” ’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For Yahweh says concerning the house of the king of Judah: </div><div class='q'>“You are Gilead to me, </div><div class='q2'>the head of Lebanon. </div><div class='q'>Yet surely I will make you a wilderness, </div><div class='q2'>cities which are not inhabited. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I will prepare destroyers against you, </div><div class='q2'>everyone with his weapons, </div><div class='q'>and they will cut down your choice cedars, </div><div class='q2'>and cast them into the fire. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>“Many nations will pass by this city, and they will each ask his neighbor, ‘Why has Yahweh done this to this great city?’  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then they will answer, ‘Because they abandoned the covenant of Yahweh their God, worshiped other gods, and served them.’ ” </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Don’t weep for the dead. </div><div class='q2'>Don’t bemoan him; </div><div class='q'>but weep bitterly for him who goes away, </div><div class='q2'>for he will return no more, </div><div class='q2'>and not see his native country. </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For Yahweh says touching Shallum the son of Josiah, king of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah his father, and who went out of this place: “He won’t return there any more.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But he will die in the place where they have led him captive.
