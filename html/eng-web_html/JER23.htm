Behold, I will visit on you the evil of your doings,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>“I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they will be fruitful and multiply.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I will set up shepherds over them, who will feed them. They will no longer be afraid or dismayed, neither will any be lacking,” says Yahweh. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>“Behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, </div><div class='q2'>“that I will raise to David a righteous Branch, </div><div class='q'>and he will reign as king and deal wisely, </div><div class='q2'>and will execute justice and righteousness in the land. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>In his days Judah will be saved, </div><div class='q2'>and Israel will dwell safely. </div><div class='q'>This is his name by which he will be called: </div><div class='q2'>Yahweh our righteousness. </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>“Therefore behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that they will no more say, ‘As Yahweh lives, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;’  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>but, ‘As Yahweh lives, who brought up and who led the offspring of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all the countries where I had driven them.’ Then they will dwell in their own land.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Concerning the prophets: </div><div class='q'>My heart within me is broken. </div><div class='q2'>All my bones shake. </div><div class='q'>I am like a drunken man, </div><div class='q2'>and like a man whom wine has overcome, </div><div class='q'>because of Yahweh, </div><div class='q2'>and because of his holy words. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For the land is full of adulterers; </div><div class='q2'>for because of the curse the land mourns. </div><div class='q'>The pastures of the wilderness have dried up. </div><div class='q2'>Their course is evil, </div><div class='q2'>and their might is not right; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>for both prophet and priest are profane. </div><div class='q2'>Yes, in my house I have found their wickedness,” says Yahweh. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Therefore their way will be to them as slippery places in the darkness. </div><div class='q2'>They will be driven on, </div><div class='q2'>and fall therein; </div><div class='q'>for I will bring evil on them, </div><div class='q2'>even the year of their visitation,” says Yahweh. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>“I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria. </div><div class='q2'>They prophesied by Baal, </div><div class='q2'>and caused my people Israel to err. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>In the prophets of Jerusalem I have also seen a horrible thing: </div><div class='q2'>they commit adultery and walk in lies. </div><div class='q'>They strengthen the hands of evildoers, </div><div class='q2'>so that no one returns from his wickedness. </div><div class='q'>They have all become to me as Sodom, </div><div class='q2'>and its inhabitants as Gomorrah.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Therefore Yahweh of Armies says concerning the prophets: </div><div class='q'>“Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, </div><div class='q2'>and make them drink poisoned water; </div><div class='q2'>for from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has gone out into all the land.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Yahweh of Armies says, </div><div class='q'>“Don’t listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you. </div><div class='q2'>They teach you vanity. </div><div class='q2'>They speak a vision of their own heart, </div><div class='q2'>and not out of the mouth of Yahweh. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>They say continually to those who despise me, </div><div class='q2'>‘Yahweh has said, “You will have peace;” ’ </div><div class='q'>and to everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his own heart they say, </div><div class='q2'>‘No evil will come on you.’ </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For who has stood in the council of Yahweh, </div><div class='q2'>that he should perceive and hear his word?
