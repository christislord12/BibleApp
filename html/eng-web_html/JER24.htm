The good figs are very good, and the bad are very bad, so bad that can’t be eaten.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>“Yahweh, the God of Israel says: ‘Like these good figs, so I will regard the captives of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans, for good.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For I will set my eyes on them for good, and I will bring them again to this land. I will build them, and not pull them down. I will plant them, and not pluck them up.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I will give them a heart to know me, that I am Yahweh. They will be my people, and I will be their God; for they will return to me with their whole heart. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>“ ‘As the bad figs, which can’t be eaten, they are so bad,’ surely Yahweh says, ‘So I will give up Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the remnant of Jerusalem, who remain in this land, and those who dwell in the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I will even give them up to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil; to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places where I will drive them.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, until they are consumed from off the land that I gave to them and to their fathers.’ ” </div><ul class='tnav'>
