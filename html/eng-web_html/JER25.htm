I will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and a hissing, and perpetual desolations.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the lamp.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>This whole land will be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations will serve the king of Babylon seventy years. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>“It will happen, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation,” says Yahweh, “for their iniquity. I will make the land of the Chaldeans desolate forever.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I will bring on that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For many nations and great kings will make bondservants of them, even of them. I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the work of their hands.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For Yahweh, the God of Israel, says to me: “Take this cup of the wine of wrath from my hand, and cause all the nations to whom I send you to drink it.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>They will drink, and reel back and forth, and be insane, because of the sword that I will send among them.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then I took the cup at Yahweh’s hand, and made all the nations to drink, to whom Yahweh had sent me:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, with its kings and its princes, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, a hissing, and a curse, as it is today;  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Pharaoh king of Egypt, with his servants, his princes, and all his people;  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>and all the mixed people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, all the kings of the Philistines, Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod;  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Edom, Moab, and the children of Ammon;  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>and all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the isle which is beyond the sea;  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all who have the corners of their beard cut off;  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>and all the kings of Arabia, all the kings of the mixed people who dwell in the wilderness;  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>and all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes;  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>and all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another; and all the kingdoms of the world, which are on the surface of the earth.
