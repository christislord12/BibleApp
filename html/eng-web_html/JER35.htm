We have no vineyard, field, or seed;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>but we have lived in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, we said, ‘Come! Let’s go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians; so we will dwell at Jerusalem.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>“Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, “Will you not receive instruction to listen to my words?” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>“The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab that he commanded his sons, not to drink wine, are performed; and to this day they drink none, for they obey their father’s commandment; but I have spoken to you, rising up early and speaking, and you have not listened to me.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>I have sent also to you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, ‘Every one of you must return now from his evil way, amend your doings, and don’t go after other gods to serve them, then you will dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers:’ but you have not inclined your ear, nor listened to me.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them, but this people has not listened to me.” ’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>“Therefore Yahweh, the God of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Behold, I will bring on Judah and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them; because I have spoken to them, but they have not heard; and I have called to them, but they have not answered.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, “Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Because you have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according to all that he commanded you;’  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>therefore Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Jonadab the son of Rechab will not lack a man to stand before me forever.’ ” </div><ul class='tnav'>
