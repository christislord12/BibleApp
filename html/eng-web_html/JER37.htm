They will take it and burn it with fire.” ’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>“Yahweh says, ‘Don’t deceive yourselves, saying, “The Chaldeans will surely depart from us;” for they will not depart.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For though you had struck the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you, and only wounded men remained among them, they would each rise up in his tent and burn this city with fire.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>When the army of the Chaldeans had broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh’s army,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>then Jeremiah went out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to receive his portion there, in the middle of the people.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>When he was in Benjamin’s gate, a captain of the guard was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he seized Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “You are defecting to the Chaldeans!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then Jeremiah said, “That is false! I am not defecting to the Chaldeans.” </div><div class='p'>But he didn’t listen to him; so Irijah seized Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The princes were angry with Jeremiah, and struck him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe; for they had made that the prison. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>When Jeremiah had come into the dungeon house, and into the cells, and Jeremiah had remained there many days,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>then Zedekiah the king sent, and had him brought out. The king asked him secretly in his house, “Is there any word from Yahweh?” </div><div class='p'>Jeremiah said, “There is.” He also said, “You will be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Moreover Jeremiah said to king Zedekiah, “How have I sinned against you, against your servants, or against this people, that you have put me in prison?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Now where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you, nor against this land?’  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Now please hear, my lord the king: please let my supplication be presented before you, that you not cause me to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then Zedekiah the king commanded, and they committed Jeremiah into the court of the guard. They gave him daily a loaf of bread out of the bakers’ street, until all the bread in the city was gone. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard. </div><ul class='tnav'>
