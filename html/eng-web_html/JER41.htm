Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the children of Ammon. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Now when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, then they were glad.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So all the people who Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned about and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the children of Ammon. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces who were with him took all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after he had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the men of war, with the women, the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gibeon.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>They departed and lived in Geruth Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor over the land. </div><ul class='tnav'>
