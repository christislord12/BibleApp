Without him, nothing was made that has been made.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>In him was life, and the life was the light of men.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness hasn’t overcome <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> The word translated “overcome” (κατέλαβεν) can also be translated “comprehended.” It refers to getting a grip on an enemy to defeat him. </span></a> it.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The same came as a witness, that he might testify about the light, that all might believe through him.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>He was not the light, but was sent that he might testify about the light.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The true light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world didn’t recognize him.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>He came to his own, and those who were his own didn’t receive him.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But as many as received him, to them he gave the right to become God’s children, to those who believe in his name:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The Word became flesh, and lived among us. We saw his glory, such glory as of the one and only Son of the Father, full of grace and truth.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>John testified about him. He cried out, saying, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me has surpassed me, for he was before me.’ ”  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>From his fullness we all received grace upon grace.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For the law was given through Moses. Grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>No one has seen God at any time. The one and only Son,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> NU reads “God”</span></a> who is in the bosom of the Father, has declared him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>This is John’s testimony, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>He declared, and didn’t deny, but he declared, “I am not the Christ.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>They asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?” </div><div class='p'>He said, “I am not.” </div><div class='p'>“Are you the prophet?” </div><div class='p'>He answered, “No.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>They said therefore to him, “Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>He said, “I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Isaiah 40:3</span></a> as Isaiah the prophet said.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The ones who had been sent were from the Pharisees.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>They asked him, “Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>John answered them, “I baptize in water, but among you stands one whom you don’t know.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>He is the one who comes after me, who is preferred before me, whose sandal strap I’m not worthy to loosen.”  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>The next day, he saw Jesus coming to him, and said, “Behold,<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> “Behold”, from “ἰδοὺ”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at.

It was about the tenth hour.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> 4:00 p.m.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>One of the two who heard John and followed him was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>He first found his own brother, Simon, and said to him, “We have found the Messiah!” (which is, being interpreted, Christ<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> “Messiah” (Hebrew) and “Christ” (Greek) both mean “Anointed One”.</span></a>).  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>He brought him to Jesus.
