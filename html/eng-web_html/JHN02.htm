Jesus’ mother was there.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Jesus also was invited, with his disciples, to the wedding.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>When the wine ran out, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They have no wine.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Jesus said to her, <span class='wj'>“Woman, what does that have to do with you and me?

You have kept the good wine until now!”  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>This beginning of his signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>After this, he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, his brothers, and his disciples; and they stayed there a few days.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He found in the temple those who sold oxen, sheep, and doves, and the changers of money sitting.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He made a whip of cords, and threw all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the changers’ money and overthrew their tables.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>To those who sold the doves, he said, <span class='wj'>“Take these things out of here! Don’t make my Father’s house a marketplace!”</span>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>His disciples remembered that it was written, “Zeal for your house will eat me up.”<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Psalm 69:9</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The Jews therefore answered him, “What sign do you show us, seeing that you do these things?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Jesus answered them, <span class='wj'>“Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The Jews therefore said, “It took forty-six years to build this temple!
