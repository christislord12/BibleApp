Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“Most certainly I tell you, unless one is born of water and spirit, he can’t enter into God’s Kingdom.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>That which is born of the flesh is flesh. That which is born of the Spirit is spirit. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Don’t marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born anew.’ </span>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>The wind</span><a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> The same Greek word (πνεῦμα) means wind, breath, and spirit.</span></a> <span class='wj'>blows where it wants to, and you hear its sound, but don’t know where it comes from and where it is going.

He who doesn’t believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>This is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>For everyone who does evil hates the light, and doesn’t come to the light, lest his works would be exposed. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his works may be revealed, that they have been done in God.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>After these things, Jesus came with his disciples into the land of Judea. He stayed there with them and baptized.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>John also was baptizing in Enon near Salim, because there was much water there. They came, and were baptized;  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>for John was not yet thrown into prison.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Therefore a dispute arose on the part of John’s disciples with some Jews about purification.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>They came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified, behold, he baptizes, and everyone is coming to him.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>John answered, “A man can receive nothing unless it has been given him from heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>You yourselves testify that I said, ‘I am not the Christ,’ but, ‘I have been sent before him.’  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice.

He who comes from heaven is above all.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>What he has seen and heard, of that he testifies; and no one receives his witness.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>He who has received his witness has set his seal to this, that God is true.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for God gives the Spirit without measure.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>One who believes in the Son has eternal life, but one who disobeys <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> The same word can be translated “disobeys” or “disbelieves” in this context.</span></a> the Son won’t see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.” </div><ul class='tnav'>
