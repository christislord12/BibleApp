<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 7</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>After these things, Jesus was walking in Galilee, for he wouldn’t walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Now the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was at hand.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>His brothers therefore said to him, “Depart from here and go into Judea, that your disciples also may see your works which you do.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For no one does anything in secret while he seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world.”  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For even his brothers didn’t believe in him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Jesus therefore said to them, <span class='wj'>“My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>The world can’t hate you, but it hates me, because I testify about it, that its works are evil. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>You go up to the feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, because my time is not yet fulfilled.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Having said these things to them, he stayed in Galilee.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly, but as it were in secret.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, “Where is he?”  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>There was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him. Some said, “He is a good man.” Others said, “Not so, but he leads the multitude astray.”  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Yet no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But when it was now the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The Jews therefore marveled, saying, “How does this man know letters, having never been educated?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Jesus therefore answered them, <span class='wj'>“My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>If anyone desires to do his will, he will know about the teaching, whether it is from God, or if I am speaking from myself. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and no unrighteousness is in him. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Didn’t Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill me?”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The multitude answered, “You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Jesus answered them, <span class='wj'>“I did one work and you all marvel because of it. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a boy. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>If a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me, because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath? </span>  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Don’t judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.” </span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Therefore some of them of Jerusalem said, “Isn’t this he whom they seek to kill?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Behold, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is truly the Christ?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>However we know where this man comes from, but when the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, <span class='wj'>“You both know me, and know where I am from. I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you don’t know. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>I know him, because I am from him, and he sent me.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>They sought therefore to take him; but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>But of the multitude, many believed in him. They said, “When the Christ comes, he won’t do more signs than those which this man has done, will he?”  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Then Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“I will be with you a little while longer, then I go to him who sent me. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>You will seek me, and won’t find me. You can’t come where I am.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>The Jews therefore said among themselves, “Where will this man go that we won’t find him? Will he go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>What is this word that he said, <span class='wj'>‘You will seek me, and won’t find me;’</span> and <span class='wj'>‘Where I am, you can’t come’</span>?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Now on the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, <span class='wj'>“If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink! </span>  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>He who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, from within him will flow rivers of living water.”</span>  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>But he said this about the Spirit, which those believing in him were to receive. For the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus wasn’t yet glorified. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Many of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, “This is truly the prophet.”  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Others said, “This is the Christ.” But some said, “What, does the Christ come out of Galilee?  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Hasn’t the Scripture said that the Christ comes of the offspring<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> or, seed</span></a> of David, <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> 2 Samuel 7:12</span></a> and from Bethlehem,<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Micah 5:2</span></a> the village where David was?”  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>So a division arose in the multitude because of him.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Some of them would have arrested him, but no one laid hands on him.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, “Why didn’t you bring him?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>The officers answered, “No man ever spoke like this man!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>The Pharisees therefore answered them, “You aren’t also led astray, are you?  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Have any of the rulers believed in him, or of the Pharisees?  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>But this multitude that doesn’t know the law is cursed.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Nicodemus (he who came to him by night, being one of them) said to them,  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>“Does our law judge a man, unless it first hears from him personally and knows what he does?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>They answered him, “Are you also from Galilee?
