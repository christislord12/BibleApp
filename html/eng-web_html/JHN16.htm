Yes, the time comes that whoever kills you will think that he offers service to God. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>They will do these things</span><a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> TR adds “to you”</span></a> <span class='wj'>because they have not known the Father, nor me. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>But I have told you these things, so that when the time comes, you may remember that I told you about them. I didn’t tell you these things from the beginning, because I was with you. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>But now I am going to him who sent me, and none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’ </span>  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>But because I have told you these things, sorrow has filled your heart. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is to your advantage that I go away, for if I don’t go away, the Counselor won’t come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>When he has come, he will convict the world about sin, about righteousness, and about judgment; </span>  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>about sin, because they don’t believe in me; </span>  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>about righteousness, because I am going to my Father, and you won’t see me any more; </span>  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>about judgment, because the prince of this world has been judged. </span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>“I still have many things to tell you, but you can’t bear them now. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>However when he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he will guide you into all truth, for he will not speak from himself; but whatever he hears, he will speak. He will declare to you things that are coming. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>He will glorify me, for he will take from what is mine, and will declare it to you. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>All things that the Father has are mine; therefore I said that he takes</span><a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> TR reads “will take” instead of “takes”</span></a> <span class='wj'>of mine and will declare it to you. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>A little while, and you will not see me.

We don’t know what he is saying.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Therefore Jesus perceived that they wanted to ask him, and he said to them, <span class='wj'>“Do you inquire among yourselves concerning this, that I said, ‘A little while, and you won’t see me, and again a little while, and you will see me?’ </span>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Most certainly I tell you that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>A woman, when she gives birth, has sorrow because her time has come. But when she has delivered the child, she doesn’t remember the anguish any more, for the joy that a human being is born into the world. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Therefore you now have sorrow, but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>“In that day you will ask me no questions.

Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be made full. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech. But the time is coming when I will no more speak to you in figures of speech, but will tell you plainly about the Father. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>In that day you will ask in my name; and I don’t say to you that I will pray to the Father for you, </span>  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came from God. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>I came from the Father, and have come into the world. Again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>His disciples said to him, “Behold, now you are speaking plainly, and using no figures of speech.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Now we know that you know all things, and don’t need for anyone to question you. By this we believe that you came from God.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Jesus answered them, <span class='wj'>“Do you now believe? </span>  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Behold, the time is coming, yes, and has now come, that you will be scattered, everyone to his own place, and you will leave me alone.
