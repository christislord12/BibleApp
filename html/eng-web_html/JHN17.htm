Glorify your Son, that your Son may also glorify you; </span>  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>even as you gave him authority over all flesh, so he will give eternal life to all whom you have given him. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>This is eternal life, that they should know you, the only true God, and him whom you sent, Jesus Christ. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>I glorified you on the earth. I have accomplished the work which you have given me to do. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Now, Father, glorify me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world existed. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>I revealed your name to the people whom you have given me out of the world. They were yours, and you have given them to me. They have kept your word. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Now they have known that all things whatever you have given me are from you, </span>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>for the words which you have given me I have given to them, and they received them, and knew for sure that I came from you. They have believed that you sent me. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>I pray for them. I don’t pray for the world, but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>All things that are mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them through your name which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name. I have kept those whom you have given me. None of them is lost except the son of destruction, that the Scripture might be fulfilled. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>But now I come to you, and I say these things in the world, that they may have my joy made full in themselves. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>I have given them your word. The world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>I pray not that you would take them from the world, but that you would keep them from the evil one. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>They are not of the world even as I am not of the world. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Sanctify them in your truth. Your word is truth.</span><a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Psalm 119:142</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>As you sent me into the world, even so I have sent them into the world. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Not for these only do I pray, but for those also who will believe in me through their word, </span>  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>that they may all be one; even as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be one in us; that the world may believe that you sent me. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>The glory which you have given me, I have given to them; that they may be one, even as we are one; </span>  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>I in them, and you in me, that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that you sent me and loved them, even as you loved me. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Father, I desire that they also whom you have given me be with me where I am, that they may see my glory, which you have given me, for you loved me before the foundation of the world. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Righteous Father, the world hasn’t known you, but I knew you; and these knew that you sent me. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>I made known to them your name, and will make it known; that the love with which you loved me may be in them, and I in them.”</span> </div><ul class='tnav'>
