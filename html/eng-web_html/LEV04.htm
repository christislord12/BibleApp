The priest shall burn them on the altar of burnt offering.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>He shall carry the bull’s skin, all its meat, with its head, and with its legs, its innards, and its dung  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>—all the rest of the bull—outside of the camp to a clean place where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire.
