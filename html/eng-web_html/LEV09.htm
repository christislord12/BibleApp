<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 9</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>On the eighth day, Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>and he said to Aaron, “Take a calf from the herd for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without defect, and offer them before Yahweh.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both a year old, without defect, for a burnt offering;  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>and a bull and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before Yahweh; and a meal offering mixed with oil: for today Yahweh appears to you.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>They brought what Moses commanded before the Tent of Meeting. All the congregation came near and stood before Yahweh.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Moses said, “This is the thing which Yahweh commanded that you should do; and Yahweh’s glory shall appear to you.”  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Moses said to Aaron, “Draw near to the altar, and offer your sin offering, and your burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself, and for the people; and offer the offering of the people, and make atonement for them, as Yahweh commanded.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>So Aaron came near to the altar, and killed the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The sons of Aaron presented the blood to him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>but the fat, and the kidneys, and the cover from the liver of the sin offering, he burned upon the altar, as Yahweh commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The meat and the skin he burned with fire outside the camp.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>He killed the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons delivered the blood to him, and he sprinkled it around on the altar.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>They delivered the burnt offering to him, piece by piece, and the head. He burned them upon the altar.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He washed the innards and the legs, and burned them on the burnt offering on the altar.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He presented the people’s offering, and took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people, and killed it, and offered it for sin, like the first.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He presented the burnt offering, and offered it according to the ordinance.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He presented the meal offering, and filled his hand from there, and burned it upon the altar, in addition to the burnt offering of the morning.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>He also killed the bull and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people. Aaron’s sons delivered to him the blood, which he sprinkled around on the altar;  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>and the fat of the bull and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covers the innards, and the kidneys, and the cover of the liver;  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burned the fat on the altar.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Aaron waved the breasts and the right thigh for a wave offering before Yahweh, as Moses commanded.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of Meeting, and came out, and blessed the people; and Yahweh’s glory appeared to all the people.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Fire came out from before Yahweh, and consumed the burnt offering and the fat upon the altar. When all the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces. </div><ul class='tnav'>
