If the hair in the plague has turned white, and the appearance of the plague is deeper than the body’s skin, it is the plague of leprosy; so the priest shall examine him and pronounce him unclean.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>If the bright spot is white in the skin of his body, and its appearance isn’t deeper than the skin, and its hair hasn’t turned white, then the priest shall isolate the infected person for seven days.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The priest shall examine him on the seventh day. Behold, if in his eyes the plague is arrested and the plague hasn’t spread in the skin, then the priest shall isolate him for seven more days.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The priest shall examine him again on the seventh day. Behold, if the plague has faded and the plague hasn’t spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean. It is a scab. He shall wash his clothes, and be clean.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But if the scab spreads on the skin after he has shown himself to the priest for his cleansing, he shall show himself to the priest again.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The priest shall examine him; and behold, if the scab has spread on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean.

Behold, if the leprosy has covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean of the plague. It has all turned white: he is clean.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But whenever raw flesh appears in him, he shall be unclean.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The priest shall examine the raw flesh, and pronounce him unclean: the raw flesh is unclean.
