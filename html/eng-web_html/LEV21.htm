Therefore they shall be holy. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>“ ‘They shall not marry a woman who is a prostitute, or profane. A priest shall not marry a woman divorced from her husband; for he is holy to his God.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Therefore you shall sanctify him, for he offers the bread of your God. He shall be holy to you, for I Yahweh, who sanctify you, am holy. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>“ ‘The daughter of any priest, if she profanes herself by playing the prostitute, she profanes her father. She shall be burned with fire. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>“ ‘He who is the high priest among his brothers, upon whose head the anointing oil is poured, and who is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not let the hair of his head hang loose, or tear his clothes.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>He must not go in to any dead body, or defile himself for his father or for his mother.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>He shall not go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him. I am Yahweh. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>“ ‘He shall take a wife in her virginity.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He shall not marry a widow, or one divorced, or a woman who has been defiled, or a prostitute. He shall take a virgin of his own people as a wife.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He shall not profane his offspring among his people, for I am Yahweh who sanctifies him.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>“Say to Aaron, ‘None of your offspring throughout their generations who has a defect may approach to offer the bread of his God.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For whatever man he is that has a defect, he shall not draw near: a blind man, or a lame, or he who has a flat nose, or any deformity,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>or a man who has an injured foot, or an injured hand,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>or hunchbacked, or a dwarf, or one who has a defect in his eye, or an itching disease, or scabs, or who has damaged testicles.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>No man of the offspring of Aaron the priest who has a defect shall come near to offer the offerings of Yahweh made by fire. Since he has a defect, he shall not come near to offer the bread of his God.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>He shall not come near to the veil, nor come near to the altar, because he has a defect; that he may not profane my sanctuaries, for I am Yahweh who sanctifies them.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>So Moses spoke to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel. </div><ul class='tnav'>
