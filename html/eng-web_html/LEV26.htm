Your land will be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Then the land will enjoy its Sabbaths as long as it lies desolate and you are in your enemies’ land. Even then the land will rest and enjoy its Sabbaths.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>As long as it lies desolate it shall have rest, even the rest which it didn’t have in your Sabbaths when you lived on it. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>“ ‘As for those of you who are left, I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies.
