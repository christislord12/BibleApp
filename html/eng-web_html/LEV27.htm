The priest shall assign a value according to his ability to pay. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>“ ‘If it is an animal of which men offer an offering to Yahweh, all that any man gives of such to Yahweh becomes holy.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He shall not alter it, nor exchange it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good. If he shall at all exchange animal for animal, then both it and that for which it is exchanged shall be holy.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>If it is any unclean animal, of which they do not offer as an offering to Yahweh, then he shall set the animal before the priest;  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>and the priest shall evaluate it, whether it is good or bad.
