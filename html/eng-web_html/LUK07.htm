<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 7</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>After he had finished speaking in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>A certain centurion’s servant, who was dear to him, was sick and at the point of death.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>When he heard about Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and save his servant.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>When they came to Jesus, they begged him earnestly, saying, “He is worthy for you to do this for him,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>for he loves our nation, and he built our synagogue for us.”  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Jesus went with them. When he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, “Lord, don’t trouble yourself, for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Therefore I didn’t even think myself worthy to come to you; but say the word, and my servant will be healed.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For I also am a man placed under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turned and said to the multitude who followed him, <span class='wj'>“I tell you, I have not found such great faith, no, not in Israel.”</span>  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Those who were sent, returning to the house, found that the servant who had been sick was well. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Soon afterwards, he went to a city called Nain. Many of his disciples, along with a great multitude, went with him.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Now when he came near to the gate of the city, behold, one who was dead was carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. Many people of the city were with her.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>When the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said to her, <span class='wj'>“Don’t cry.”</span>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He came near and touched the coffin, and the bearers stood still. He said, <span class='wj'>“Young man, I tell you, arise!”</span>  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He who was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Fear took hold of all, and they glorified God, saying, “A great prophet has arisen among us!” and, “God has visited his people!”  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>This report went out concerning him in the whole of Judea, and in all the surrounding region. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The disciples of John told him about all these things.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>John, calling to himself two of his disciples, sent them to Jesus, saying, “Are you the one who is coming, or should we look for another?”  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>When the men had come to him, they said, “John the Baptizer has sent us to you, saying, ‘Are you he who comes, or should we look for another?’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits; and to many who were blind he gave sight.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Jesus answered them, <span class='wj'>“Go and tell John the things which you have seen and heard: that the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Blessed is he who finds no occasion for stumbling in me.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>When John’s messengers had departed, he began to tell the multitudes about John, <span class='wj'>“What did you go out into the wilderness to see?

Behold, those who are gorgeously dressed, and live delicately, are in kings’ courts. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>This is he of whom it is written,</span> </div><div class='q'><span class='wj'>‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face,</span> </div><div class='q2'><span class='wj'>who will prepare your way before you.’</span><a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Malachi 3:1</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>“For I tell you, among those who are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptizer, yet he who is least in God’s Kingdom is greater than he.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>When all the people and the tax collectors heard this, they declared God to be just, having been baptized with John’s baptism.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God, not being baptized by him themselves. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> TR adds “But the Lord said,”</span></a> <span class='wj'>“To what then should I compare the people of this generation?
