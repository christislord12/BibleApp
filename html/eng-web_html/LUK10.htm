Pray therefore to the Lord of the harvest, that he may send out laborers into his harvest. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Go your ways. Behold, I send you out as lambs among wolves. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Carry no purse, nor wallet, nor sandals. Greet no one on the way. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Into whatever house you enter, first say, ‘Peace be to this house.’ </span>  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>If a son of peace is there, your peace will rest on him; but if not, it will return to you. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Remain in that same house, eating and drinking the things they give, for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Don’t go from house to house. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Into whatever city you enter, and they receive you, eat the things that are set before you. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Heal the sick who are there, and tell them, ‘God’s Kingdom has come near to you.’ </span>  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>But into whatever city you enter, and they don’t receive you, go out into its streets and say, </span>  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>‘Even the dust from your city that clings to us, we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this, that God’s Kingdom has come near to you.’ </span>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>I tell you, it will be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>You, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, will be brought down to Hades. </span><a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Hades is the lower realm of the dead, or Hell.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Whoever listens to you listens to me, and whoever rejects you rejects me.

Nothing will in any way hurt you. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Nevertheless, don’t rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>In that same hour Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, <span class='wj'>“I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Turning to the disciples, he said, <span class='wj'>“All things have been delivered to me by my Father.

When he saw him, he passed by on the other side. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>In the same way a Levite also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>But a certain Samaritan, as he traveled, came where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion, </span>  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. He set him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>On the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii, gave them to the host, and said to him, ‘Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you when I return.’ </span>  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Now which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>He said, “He who showed mercy on him.” </div><div class='p'>Then Jesus said to him, <span class='wj'>“Go and do likewise.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>As they went on their way, he entered into a certain village, and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>She had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus’ feet, and heard his word.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>But Martha was distracted with much serving, and she came up to him, and said, “Lord, don’t you care that my sister left me to serve alone? Ask her therefore to help me.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Jesus answered her, <span class='wj'>“Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things, </span>  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>but one thing is needed.
