Cut it down. Why does it waste the soil?’ </span>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>He answered, ‘Lord, leave it alone this year also, until I dig around it and fertilize it. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>If it bears fruit, fine; but if not, after that, you can cut it down.’ ”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath day.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years. She was bent over, and could in no way straighten herself up.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>When Jesus saw her, he called her, and said to her, <span class='wj'>“Woman, you are freed from your infirmity.”</span>  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He laid his hands on her, and immediately she stood up straight and glorified God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The ruler of the synagogue, being indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said to the multitude, “There are six days in which men ought to work. Therefore come on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Therefore the Lord answered him, <span class='wj'>“You hypocrites! Doesn’t each one of you free his ox or his donkey from the stall on the Sabbath, and lead him away to water? </span>  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham whom Satan had bound eighteen long years, be freed from this bondage on the Sabbath day?” </span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>As he said these things, all his adversaries were disappointed and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>He said, <span class='wj'>“What is God’s Kingdom like? To what shall I compare it? </span>  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>It is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and put in his own garden. It grew and became a large tree, and the birds of the sky live in its branches.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Again he said, <span class='wj'>“To what shall I compare God’s Kingdom? </span>  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>It is like yeast, which a woman took and hid in three measures </span><a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> literally, three sata. 3 sata is about 39 liters or a bit more than a bushel.</span></a> <span class='wj'>of flour, until it was all leavened.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>He went on his way through cities and villages, teaching, and traveling on to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>One said to him, “Lord, are they few who are saved?” </div><div class='p'>He said to them,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>“Strive to enter in by the narrow door, for many, I tell you, will seek to enter in and will not be able. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>When once the master of the house has risen up, and has shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, ‘Lord, Lord, open to us!’ then he will answer and tell you, ‘I don’t know you or where you come from.’ </span>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Then you will begin to say, ‘We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.’ </span>  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>He will say, ‘I tell you, I don’t know where you come from. Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity.’ </span>  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets in God’s Kingdom, and yourselves being thrown outside. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>They will come from the east, west, north, and south, and will sit down in God’s Kingdom. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Behold, there are some who are last who will be first, and there are some who are first who will be last.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>On that same day, some Pharisees came, saying to him, “Get out of here, and go away, for Herod wants to kill you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>He said to them, <span class='wj'>“Go and tell that fox, ‘Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I complete my mission. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Nevertheless I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the next day, for it can’t be that a prophet would perish outside of Jerusalem.’</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>“Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her!
