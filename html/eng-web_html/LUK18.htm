<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 18</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>He also spoke a parable to them that they must always pray, and not give up,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>saying, <span class='wj'>“There was a judge in a certain city who didn’t fear God, and didn’t respect man. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>A widow was in that city, and she often came to him, saying, ‘Defend me from my adversary!’ </span>  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>He wouldn’t for a while, but afterward he said to himself, ‘Though I neither fear God, nor respect man, </span>  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>yet because this widow bothers me, I will defend her, or else she will wear me out by her continual coming.’ ”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The Lord said, <span class='wj'>“Listen to what the unrighteous judge says. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Won’t God avenge his chosen ones who are crying out to him day and night, and yet he exercises patience with them? </span>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>I tell you that he will avenge them quickly. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>He spoke also this parable to certain people who were convinced of their own righteousness, and who despised all others.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>“Two men went up into the temple to pray; one was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax collector. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>The Pharisee stood and prayed to himself like this: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like the rest of men, extortionists, unrighteous, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>I fast twice a week. I give tithes of all that I get.’ </span>  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>But the tax collector, standing far away, wouldn’t even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’ </span>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>They were also bringing their babies to him, that he might touch them. But when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Jesus summoned them, saying, <span class='wj'>“Allow the little children to come to me, and don’t hinder them, for God’s Kingdom belongs to such as these. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Most certainly, I tell you, whoever doesn’t receive God’s Kingdom like a little child, he will in no way enter into it.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>A certain ruler asked him, saying, “Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Jesus asked him, <span class='wj'>“Why do you call me good? No one is good, except one: God. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>You know the commandments: ‘Don’t commit adultery,’ ‘Don’t murder,’ ‘Don’t steal,’ ‘Don’t give false testimony,’ ‘Honor your father and your mother.’ ”</span><a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>He said, “I have observed all these things from my youth up.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>When Jesus heard these things, he said to him, <span class='wj'>“You still lack one thing. Sell all that you have, and distribute it to the poor. Then you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was very rich. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Jesus, seeing that he became very sad, said, <span class='wj'>“How hard it is for those who have riches to enter into God’s Kingdom! </span>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>For it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle’s eye than for a rich man to enter into God’s Kingdom.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Those who heard it said, “Then who can be saved?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But he said, <span class='wj'>“The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Peter said, “Look, we have left everything and followed you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>He said to them, <span class='wj'>“Most certainly I tell you, there is no one who has left house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children, for God’s Kingdom’s sake, </span>  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>who will not receive many times more in this time, and in the world to come, eternal life.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>He took the twelve aside, and said to them, <span class='wj'>“Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written through the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be completed. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>For he will be delivered up to the Gentiles, will be mocked, treated shamefully, and spit on. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>They will scourge and kill him. On the third day, he will rise again.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>They understood none of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they didn’t understand the things that were said.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>As he came near Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the road, begging.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Hearing a multitude going by, he asked what this meant.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>They told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>He cried out, “Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me!”  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Those who led the way rebuked him, that he should be quiet; but he cried out all the more, “You son of David, have mercy on me!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Standing still, Jesus commanded him to be brought to him. When he had come near, he asked him,  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>“What do you want me to do?”</span> </div><div class='p'>He said, “Lord, that I may see again.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Jesus said to him, <span class='wj'>“Receive your sight. Your faith has healed you.” </span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Immediately he received his sight and followed him, glorifying God. All the people, when they saw it, praised God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
