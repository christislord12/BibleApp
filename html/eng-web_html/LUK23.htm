He hoped to see some miracle done by him.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>He questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Herod with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him. Dressing him in luxurious clothing, they sent him back to Pilate.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with each other. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>and said to them, “You brought this man to me as one that perverts the people, and behold, having examined him before you, I found no basis for a charge against this man concerning those things of which you accuse him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Neither has Herod, for I sent you to him, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I will therefore chastise him and release him.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Now he had to release one prisoner to them at the feast.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> NU omits verse 17.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But they all cried out together, saying, “Away with this man! Release to us Barabbas!”—  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>one who was thrown into prison for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then Pilate spoke to them again, wanting to release Jesus,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>but they shouted, saying, “Crucify! Crucify him!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>He said to them the third time, “Why? What evil has this man done? I have found no capital crime in him. I will therefore chastise him and release him.”  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. Their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Pilate decreed that what they asked for should be done.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>He released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Jesus up to their will. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>When they led him away, they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it after Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>A great multitude of the people followed him, including women who also mourned and lamented him.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But Jesus, turning to them, said, <span class='wj'>“Daughters of Jerusalem, don’t weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>For behold, the days are coming in which they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.’ </span>  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Then they will begin to tell the mountains, ‘Fall on us!’ and tell the hills, ‘Cover us.’</span><a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Hosea 10:8</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>For if they do these things in the green tree, what will be done in the dry?”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>There were also others, two criminals, led with him to be put to death.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>When they came to the place that is called “The Skull”, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“Father, forgive them, for they don’t know what they are doing.”</span> </div><div class='p'>Dividing his garments among them, they cast lots.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>The people stood watching.
