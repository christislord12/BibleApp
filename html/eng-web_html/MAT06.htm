Most certainly I tell you, they have received their reward. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>But when you do merciful deeds, don’t let your left hand know what your right hand does, </span>  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>so that your merciful deeds may be in secret, then your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>“When you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Most certainly, I tell you, they have received their reward. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>But you, when you pray, enter into your inner room, and having shut your door, pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>In praying, don’t use vain repetitions, as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard for their much speaking. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Therefore don’t be like them, for your Father knows what things you need, before you ask him. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Pray like this: ‘Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Let your Kingdom come. Let your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Give us today our daily bread. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.

Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow.
