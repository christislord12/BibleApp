Be made clean.”</span> Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Jesus said to him, <span class='wj'>“See that you tell nobody, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>When he came into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking him,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>and saying, “Lord, my servant lies in the house paralyzed, grievously tormented.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Jesus said to him, <span class='wj'>“I will come and heal him.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The centurion answered, “Lord, I’m not worthy for you to come under my roof. Just say the word, and my servant will be healed.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For I am also a man under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and tell another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and tell my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>When Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to those who followed, <span class='wj'>“Most certainly I tell you, I haven’t found so great a faith, not even in Israel. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>I tell you that many will come from the east and the west, and will sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven, </span>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>but the children of the Kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”</span>  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Jesus said to the centurion, <span class='wj'>“Go your way. Let it be done for you as you have believed.”</span> His servant was healed in that hour. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>When Jesus came into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s mother lying sick with a fever.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He touched her hand, and the fever left her.
