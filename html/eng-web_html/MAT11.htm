We mourned for you, and you didn’t lament.’ </span>  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon.’ </span>  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ But wisdom is justified by her children.”</span><a href="#FN5" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> NU reads “actions” instead of “children”</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then he began to denounce the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done, because they didn’t repent.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>“Woe to you, Chorazin!
