Because they had no root, they withered away. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Others fell among thorns. The thorns grew up and choked them. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Others fell on good soil, and yielded fruit: some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The disciples came, and said to him, “Why do you speak to them in parables?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>He answered them, <span class='wj'>“To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but it is not given to them. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>For whoever has, to him will be given, and he will have abundance, but whoever doesn’t have, from him will be taken away even that which he has. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they don’t see, and hearing, they don’t hear, neither do they understand. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>In them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, which says, </span> </div><div class='q'><span class='wj'>‘By hearing you will hear,</span> </div><div class='q2'><span class='wj'>and will in no way understand;</span> </div><div class='q'><span class='wj'>Seeing you will see,</span> </div><div class='q2'><span class='wj'>and will in no way perceive:</span> </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>for this people’s heart has grown callous,</span> </div><div class='q2'><span class='wj'>their ears are dull of hearing,</span> </div><div class='q2'><span class='wj'>they have closed their eyes;</span> </div><div class='q'><span class='wj'>or else perhaps they might perceive with their eyes,</span> </div><div class='q2'><span class='wj'>hear with their ears,</span> </div><div class='q2'><span class='wj'>understand with their heart,</span> </div><div class='q'><span class='wj'>and would turn again;</span> </div><div class='q2'><span class='wj'>and I would heal them.’</span><a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Isaiah 6:9-10</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>“But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>For most certainly I tell you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which you see, and didn’t see them; and to hear the things which you hear, and didn’t hear them.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>“Hear, then, the parable of the farmer. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>When anyone hears the word of the Kingdom, and doesn’t understand it, the evil one comes, and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart.
