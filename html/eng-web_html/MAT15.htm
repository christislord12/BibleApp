He gave thanks and broke them, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>They all ate, and were filled. They took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Those who ate were four thousand men, in addition to women and children.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Then he sent away the multitudes, got into the boat, and came into the borders of Magdala. </div><ul class='tnav'>
