She has done a good work for me. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>For you always have the poor with you; but you don’t always have me. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>For in pouring this ointment on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Most certainly I tell you, wherever this Good News is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be spoken of as a memorial of her.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>and said, “What are you willing to give me, that I should deliver him to you?” They weighed out for him thirty pieces of silver.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>From that time he sought opportunity to betray him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Now on the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, “Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>He said, <span class='wj'>“Go into the city to a certain person, and tell him, ‘The Teacher says, “My time is at hand.

It would be better for that man if he had not been born.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Judas, who betrayed him, answered, “It isn’t me, is it, Rabbi?” </div><div class='p'>He said to him, <span class='wj'>“You said it.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>As they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks for<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> TR reads “blessed” instead of “gave thanks for”</span></a> it, and broke it. He gave to the disciples, and said, <span class='wj'>“Take, eat; this is my body.”</span>  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>He took the cup, gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, <span class='wj'>“All of you drink it, </span>  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>for this is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the remission of sins. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>But I tell you that I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on, until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father’s Kingdom.” </span>  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight, for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’</span><a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Zechariah 13:7</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.” </span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>But Peter answered him, “Even if all will be made to stumble because of you, I will never be made to stumble.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Jesus said to him, <span class='wj'>“Most certainly I tell you that tonight, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Peter said to him, “Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you.” All of the disciples also said likewise. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples, <span class='wj'>“Sit here, while I go there and pray.”</span>  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and severely troubled.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Then he said to them, <span class='wj'>“My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here, and watch with me.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>He went forward a little, fell on his face, and prayed, saying, <span class='wj'>“My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me; nevertheless, not what I desire, but what you desire.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>He came to the disciples, and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, <span class='wj'>“What, couldn’t you watch with me for one hour? </span>  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Watch and pray, that you don’t enter into temptation.

Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Arise, let’s be going. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand.” </span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>While he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Now he who betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, “Whoever I kiss, he is the one. Seize him.”  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Immediately he came to Jesus, and said, “Hail, Rabbi!” and kissed him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Jesus said to him, <span class='wj'>“Friend, why are you here?”</span> Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>Then Jesus said to him, <span class='wj'>“Put your sword back into its place, for all those who take the sword will die by the sword. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Or do you think that I couldn’t ask my Father, and he would even now send me more than twelve legions of angels? </span>  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so?” </span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, <span class='wj'>“Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me?

Even though many false witnesses came forward, they found none. But at last two false witnesses came forward,  <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>and said, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>The high priest stood up, and said to him, “Have you no answer? What is this that these testify against you?”  <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>But Jesus held his peace. The high priest answered him, “I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#160;</span>Jesus said to him, <span class='wj'>“You have said it. Nevertheless, I tell you, after this you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of the sky.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V65">65&#160;</span>Then the high priest tore his clothing, saying, “He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy.  <span class="verse" id="V66">66&#160;</span>What do you think?” </div><div class='p'>They answered, “He is worthy of death!”  <span class="verse" id="V67">67&#160;</span>Then they spat in his face and beat him with their fists, and some slapped him,  <span class="verse" id="V68">68&#160;</span>saying, “Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who hit you?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V69">69&#160;</span>Now Peter was sitting outside in the court, and a maid came to him, saying, “You were also with Jesus, the Galilean!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V70">70&#160;</span>But he denied it before them all, saying, “I don’t know what you are talking about.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V71">71&#160;</span>When he had gone out onto the porch, someone else saw him, and said to those who were there, “This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V72">72&#160;</span>Again he denied it with an oath, “I don’t know the man.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V73">73&#160;</span>After a little while those who stood by came and said to Peter, “Surely you are also one of them, for your speech makes you known.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V74">74&#160;</span>Then he began to curse and to swear, “I don’t know the man!” </div><div class='p'>Immediately the rooster crowed.  <span class="verse" id="V75">75&#160;</span>Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said to him, <span class='wj'>“Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”</span> Then he went out and wept bitterly. </div><ul class='tnav'>
