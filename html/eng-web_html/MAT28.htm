Come, see the place where the Lord was lying.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you will see him.’ Behold, I have told you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>As they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, <span class='wj'>“Rejoice!”</span> </div><div class='p'>They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“Don’t be afraid.
