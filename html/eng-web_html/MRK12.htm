Come, let’s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’ </span>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>They took him, killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the farmers, and will give the vineyard to others. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Haven’t you even read this Scripture:</span> </div><div class='q'><span class='wj'>‘The stone which the builders rejected</span> </div><div class='q2'><span class='wj'>was made the head of the corner.</span> </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>This was from the Lord.</span> </div><div class='q2'><span class='wj'>It is marvelous in our eyes’?”</span><a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Psalm 118:22-23</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>They tried to seize him, but they feared the multitude; for they perceived that he spoke the parable against them. They left him, and went away.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>They sent some of the Pharisees and the Herodians to him, that they might trap him with words.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>When they had come, they asked him, “Teacher, we know that you are honest, and don’t defer to anyone; for you aren’t partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Shall we give, or shall we not give?” </div><div class='p'>But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, <span class='wj'>“Why do you test me? Bring me a denarius, that I may see it.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>They brought it. </div><div class='p'>He said to them, <span class='wj'>“Whose is this image and inscription?”</span> </div><div class='p'>They said to him, “Caesar’s.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Jesus answered them, <span class='wj'>“Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”</span> </div><div class='p'>They marveled greatly at him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Some Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection, came to him. They asked him, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>“Teacher, Moses wrote to us, ‘If a man’s brother dies, and leaves a wife behind him, and leaves no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up offspring for his brother.’  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>There were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and dying left no offspring.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The second took her, and died, leaving no children behind him. The third likewise;  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>and the seven took her and left no children. Last of all the woman also died.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>In the resurrection, when they rise, whose wife will she be of them? For the seven had her as a wife.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Jesus answered them, <span class='wj'>“Isn’t this because you are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God? </span>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>For when they will rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>But about the dead, that they are raised; haven’t you read in the book of Moses, about the Bush, how God spoke to him, saying, ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’?</span><a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Exodus 3:6</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are therefore badly mistaken.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>One of the scribes came, and heard them questioning together, and knowing that he had answered them well, asked him, “Which commandment is the greatest of all?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“The greatest is, ‘Hear, Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one: </span>  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.’</span><a href="#FN3" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Deuteronomy 6:4-5</span></a> <span class='wj'>This is the first commandment. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>The second is like this, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’</span><a href="#FN4" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Leviticus 19:18</span></a> <span class='wj'>There is no other commandment greater than these.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>The scribe said to him, “Truly, teacher, you have said well that he is one, and there is none other but he,  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>When Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, <span class='wj'>“You are not far from God’s Kingdom.”</span> </div><div class='p'>No one dared ask him any question after that.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Jesus responded, as he taught in the temple, <span class='wj'>“How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David? </span>  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>For David himself said in the Holy Spirit,</span> </div><div class='q'><span class='wj'>‘The Lord said to my Lord,</span> </div><div class='q2'><span class='wj'>“Sit at my right hand,</span> </div><div class='q2'><span class='wj'>until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet.” ’</span><a href="#FN5" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Psalm 110:1</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Therefore David himself calls him Lord, so how can he be his son?” </span> </div><div class='p'>The common people heard him gladly.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>In his teaching he said to them, <span class='wj'>“Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and to get greetings in the marketplaces, </span>  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>and the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts: </span>  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>those who devour widows’ houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Jesus sat down opposite the treasury, and saw how the multitude cast money into the treasury. Many who were rich cast in much.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>A poor widow came, and she cast in two small brass coins,<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> literally, lepta (or widow’s mites).
