Looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were amazed.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>He said to them, “Don’t be amazed. You seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has risen. He is not here. Behold, the place where they laid him!  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But go, tell his disciples and Peter, ‘He goes before you into Galilee.
