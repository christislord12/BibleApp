You shall make them of beaten work. You shall use them for the calling of the congregation, and for the journeying of the camps.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>When they blow them, all the congregation shall gather themselves to you at the door of the Tent of Meeting.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>If they blow just one, then the princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves to you.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>When you blow an alarm, the camps that lie on the east side shall go forward.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>When you blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie on the south side shall go forward. They shall blow an alarm for their journeys.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But when the assembly is to be gathered together, you shall blow, but you shall not sound an alarm. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>“The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets. This shall be to you for a statute forever throughout your generations.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>When you go to war in your land against the adversary who oppresses you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets. Then you will be remembered before Yahweh your God, and you will be saved from your enemies. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>“Also in the day of your gladness, and in your set feasts, and in the beginnings of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; and they shall be to you for a memorial before your God. I am Yahweh your God.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>In the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle of the covenant.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The children of Israel went forward on their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud stayed in the wilderness of Paran.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>They first went forward according to the commandment of Yahweh by Moses. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>First, the standard of the camp of the children of Judah went forward according to their armies.
