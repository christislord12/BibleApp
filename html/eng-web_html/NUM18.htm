A stranger shall not come near to you. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>“You shall perform the duty of the sanctuary and the duty of the altar, that there be no more wrath on the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Behold, I myself have taken your brothers the Levites from among the children of Israel. They are a gift to you, dedicated to Yahweh, to do the service of the Tent of Meeting.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>You and your sons with you shall keep your priesthood for everything of the altar, and for that within the veil. You shall serve. I give you the service of the priesthood as a gift.
