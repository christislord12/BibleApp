Afterward you shall be gathered to your people.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Moses spoke to the people, saying, “Arm men from among you for war, that they may go against Midian, to execute Yahweh’s vengeance on Midian.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> You shall send one thousand out of every tribe, throughout all the tribes of Israel, to the war.”  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>So there were delivered, out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand from every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Moses sent them, one thousand of every tribe, to the war with Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>They fought against Midian, as Yahweh commanded Moses. They killed every male.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>They killed the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian. They also killed Balaam the son of Beor with the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The children of Israel took the women of Midian captive with their little ones; and all their livestock, all their flocks, and all their goods, they took as plunder.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>All their cities in the places in which they lived, and all their encampments, they burned with fire.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>They took all the captives, and all the plunder, both of man and of animal.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>They brought the captives with the prey and the plunder, to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the children of Israel, to the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by the Jordan at Jericho.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Moses and Eleazar the priest, with all the princes of the congregation, went out to meet them outside of the camp.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Moses was angry with the officers of the army, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, who came from the service of the war.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Moses said to them, “Have you saved all the women alive?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against Yahweh in the matter of Peor, and so the plague was among the congregation of Yahweh.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known man by lying with him.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But all the girls, who have not known man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>“Encamp outside of the camp for seven days.
