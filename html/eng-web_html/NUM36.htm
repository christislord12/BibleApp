My lord was commanded by Yahweh to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>If they are married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers, and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they shall belong. So it will be taken away from the lot of our inheritance.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>When the jubilee of the children of Israel comes, then their inheritance will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they shall belong.
