</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>to the beloved Apphia, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the assembly in your house:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>hearing of your love and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>that the fellowship of your faith may become effective in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us in Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For we have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Therefore though I have all boldness in Christ to command you that which is appropriate,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>yet for love’s sake I rather beg, being such a one as Paul, the aged, but also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I beg you for my child, whom I have become the father of in my chains, Onesimus, <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Onesimus means “useful”.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>who once was useless to you, but now is useful to you and to me.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I am sending him back. Therefore receive him, that is, my own heart,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>whom I desired to keep with me, that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, that your goodness would not be as of necessity, but of free will.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For perhaps he was therefore separated from you for a while, that you would have him forever,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much rather to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>If then you count me a partner, receive him as you would receive me.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But if he has wronged you at all or owes you anything, put that to my account.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides).  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in the Lord. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
