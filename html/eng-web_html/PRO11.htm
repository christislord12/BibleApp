delight. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>When pride comes, then comes shame, </div><div class='q2'>but with humility comes wisdom. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The integrity of the upright shall guide them, </div><div class='q2'>but the perverseness of the treacherous shall destroy them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Riches don’t profit in the day of wrath, </div><div class='q2'>but righteousness delivers from death. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The righteousness of the blameless will direct his way, </div><div class='q2'>but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them, </div><div class='q2'>but the unfaithful will be trapped by evil desires. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>When a wicked man dies, hope perishes, </div><div class='q2'>and expectation of power comes to nothing. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>A righteous person is delivered out of trouble, </div><div class='q2'>and the wicked takes his place. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>With his mouth the godless man destroys his neighbor, </div><div class='q2'>but the righteous will be delivered through knowledge. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices. </div><div class='q2'>When the wicked perish, there is shouting. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>By the blessing of the upright, the city is exalted, </div><div class='q2'>but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>One who despises his neighbor is void of wisdom, </div><div class='q2'>but a man of understanding holds his peace. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>One who brings gossip betrays a confidence, </div><div class='q2'>but one who is of a trustworthy spirit is one who keeps a secret. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Where there is no wise guidance, the nation falls, </div><div class='q2'>but in the multitude of counselors there is victory. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He who is collateral for a stranger will suffer for it, </div><div class='q2'>but he who refuses pledges of collateral is secure. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>A gracious woman obtains honor, </div><div class='q2'>but violent men obtain riches. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The merciful man does good to his own soul, </div><div class='q2'>but he who is cruel troubles his own flesh. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Wicked people earn deceitful wages, </div><div class='q2'>but one who sows righteousness reaps a sure reward. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>He who is truly righteous gets life. </div><div class='q2'>He who pursues evil gets death. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Those who are perverse in heart are an abomination to Yahweh, </div><div class='q2'>but those whose ways are blameless are his delight. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Most certainly, the evil man will not be unpunished, </div><div class='q2'>but the offspring<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> or, seed</span></a> of the righteous will be delivered. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Like a gold ring in a pig’s snout, </div><div class='q2'>is a beautiful woman who lacks discretion. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The desire of the righteous is only good. </div><div class='q2'>The expectation of the wicked is wrath. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>There is one who scatters, and increases yet more. </div><div class='q2'>There is one who withholds more than is appropriate, but gains poverty.

id="V27">27&#160;</span>He who diligently seeks good seeks favor, </div><div class='q2'>but he who searches after evil, it shall come to him. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>He who trusts in his riches will fall, </div><div class='q2'>but the righteous shall flourish as the green leaf. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse"
