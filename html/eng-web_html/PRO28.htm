</div><div class='q2'>but those who keep the law contend with them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Evil men don’t understand justice; </div><div class='q2'>but those who seek Yahweh understand it fully. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Better is the poor who walks in his integrity, </div><div class='q2'>than he who is perverse in his ways, and he is rich. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Whoever keeps the law is a wise son; </div><div class='q2'>but he who is a companion of gluttons shames his father. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>He who increases his wealth by excessive interest </div><div class='q2'>gathers it for one who has pity on the poor. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>He who turns away his ear from hearing the law, </div><div class='q2'>even his prayer is an abomination. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Whoever causes the upright to go astray in an evil way, </div><div class='q2'>he will fall into his own trap; </div><div class='q2'>but the blameless will inherit good. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The rich man is wise in his own eyes; </div><div class='q2'>but the poor who has understanding sees through him. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>When the righteous triumph, there is great glory; </div><div class='q2'>but when the wicked rise, men hide themselves. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He who conceals his sins doesn’t prosper, </div><div class='q2'>but whoever confesses and renounces them finds mercy. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Blessed is the man who always fears; </div><div class='q2'>but one who hardens his heart falls into trouble. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>As a roaring lion or a charging bear, </div><div class='q2'>so is a wicked ruler over helpless people. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>A tyrannical ruler lacks judgment. </div><div class='q2'>One who hates ill-gotten gain will have long days. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>A man who is tormented by life blood will be a fugitive until death; </div><div class='q2'>no one will support him. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Whoever walks blamelessly is kept safe; </div><div class='q2'>but one with perverse ways will fall suddenly. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>One who works his land will have an abundance of food; </div><div class='q2'>but one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>A faithful man is rich with blessings; </div><div class='q2'>but one who is eager to be rich will not go unpunished. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>To show partiality is not good; </div><div class='q2'>yet a man will do wrong for a piece of bread. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>A stingy man hurries after riches, </div><div class='q2'>and doesn’t know that poverty waits for him. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>One who rebukes a man will afterward find more favor </div><div class='q2'>than one who flatters with the tongue. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Whoever robs his father or his mother and says, “It’s not wrong,” </div><div class='q2'>is a partner with a destroyer. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>One who is greedy stirs up strife;
