<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0">Psalm 78</div><div class='d'>A contemplation by Asaph. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Hear my teaching, my people. </div><div class='q2'>Turn your ears to the words of my mouth. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I will open my mouth in a parable. </div><div class='q2'>I will utter dark sayings of old, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Which we have heard and known, </div><div class='q2'>and our fathers have told us. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>We will not hide them from their children, </div><div class='q2'>telling to the generation to come the praises of Yahweh, </div><div class='q2'>his strength, and his wondrous deeds that he has done. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For he established a covenant in Jacob, </div><div class='q2'>and appointed a teaching in Israel, </div><div class='q2'>which he commanded our fathers, </div><div class='q2'>that they should make them known to their children; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>that the generation to come might know, even the children who should be born; </div><div class='q2'>who should arise and tell their children, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>that they might set their hope in God, </div><div class='q2'>and not forget God’s deeds, </div><div class='q2'>but keep his commandments, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>and might not be as their fathers, </div><div class='q2'>a stubborn and rebellious generation, </div><div class='q2'>a generation that didn’t make their hearts loyal, </div><div class='q2'>whose spirit was not steadfast with God. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, </div><div class='q2'>turned back in the day of battle. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They didn’t keep God’s covenant, </div><div class='q2'>and refused to walk in his law. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>They forgot his doings, </div><div class='q2'>his wondrous deeds that he had shown them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers, </div><div class='q2'>in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He split the sea, and caused them to pass through. </div><div class='q2'>He made the waters stand as a heap. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>In the daytime he also led them with a cloud, </div><div class='q2'>and all night with a light of fire. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He split rocks in the wilderness, </div><div class='q2'>and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He brought streams also out of the rock, </div><div class='q2'>and caused waters to run down like rivers. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Yet they still went on to sin against him, </div><div class='q2'>to rebel against the Most High in the desert. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>They tempted God in their heart </div><div class='q2'>by asking food according to their desire. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Yes, they spoke against God. </div><div class='q2'>They said, “Can God prepare a table in the wilderness? </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out, </div><div class='q2'>and streams overflowed. </div><div class='q'>Can he give bread also? </div><div class='q2'>Will he provide meat for his people?” </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Therefore Yahweh heard, and was angry. </div><div class='q2'>A fire was kindled against Jacob, </div><div class='q2'>anger also went up against Israel, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>because they didn’t believe in God, </div><div class='q2'>and didn’t trust in his salvation. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Yet he commanded the skies above, </div><div class='q2'>and opened the doors of heaven. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>He rained down manna on them to eat, </div><div class='q2'>and gave them food from the sky. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Man ate the bread of angels. </div><div class='q2'>He sent them food to the full. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>He caused the east wind to blow in the sky. </div><div class='q2'>By his power he guided the south wind. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>He also rained meat on them as the dust, </div><div class='q2'>winged birds as the sand of the seas. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>He let them fall in the middle of their camp, </div><div class='q2'>around their habitations. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>So they ate, and were well filled. </div><div class='q2'>He gave them their own desire. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>They didn’t turn from their cravings. </div><div class='q2'>Their food was yet in their mouths, </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>when the anger of God went up against them, </div><div class='q2'>killed some of their fattest, </div><div class='q2'>and struck down the young men of Israel. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>For all this they still sinned, </div><div class='q2'>and didn’t believe in his wondrous works. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Therefore he consumed their days in vanity, </div><div class='q2'>and their years in terror. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>When he killed them, then they inquired after him. </div><div class='q2'>They returned and sought God earnestly. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>They remembered that God was their rock, </div><div class='q2'>the Most High God, their redeemer. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>But they flattered him with their mouth, </div><div class='q2'>and lied to him with their tongue. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>For their heart was not right with him, </div><div class='q2'>neither were they faithful in his covenant. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn’t destroy them. </div><div class='q2'>Yes, many times he turned his anger away, </div><div class='q2'>and didn’t stir up all his wrath. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>He remembered that they were but flesh, </div><div class='q2'>a wind that passes away, and doesn’t come again. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness, </div><div class='q2'>and grieved him in the desert! </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>They turned again and tempted God, </div><div class='q2'>and provoked the Holy One of Israel. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>They didn’t remember his hand, </div><div class='q2'>nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>how he set his signs in Egypt, </div><div class='q2'>his wonders in the field of Zoan, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>he turned their rivers into blood, </div><div class='q2'>and their streams, so that they could not drink. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; </div><div class='q2'>and frogs, which destroyed them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>He gave also their increase to the caterpillar, </div><div class='q2'>and their labor to the locust. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>He destroyed their vines with hail, </div><div class='q2'>their sycamore fig trees with frost. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>He gave over their livestock also to the hail, </div><div class='q2'>and their flocks to hot thunderbolts. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>He threw on them the fierceness of his anger, </div><div class='q2'>wrath, indignation, and trouble, </div><div class='q2'>and a band of angels of evil. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>He made a path for his anger. </div><div class='q2'>He didn’t spare their soul from death, </div><div class='q2'>but gave their life over to the pestilence, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>and struck all the firstborn in Egypt, </div><div class='q2'>the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>But he led out his own people like sheep, </div><div class='q2'>and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>He led them safely, so that they weren’t afraid, </div><div class='q2'>but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>He brought them to the border of his sanctuary, </div><div class='q2'>to this mountain, which his right hand had taken. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>He also drove out the nations before them, </div><div class='q2'>allotted them for an inheritance by line, </div><div class='q2'>and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, </div><div class='q2'>and didn’t keep his testimonies, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers. </div><div class='q2'>They were twisted like a deceitful bow. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>For they provoked him to anger with their high places, </div><div class='q2'>and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>When God heard this, he was angry, </div><div class='q2'>and greatly abhorred Israel, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>so that he abandoned the tent of Shiloh, </div><div class='q2'>the tent which he placed among men, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>and delivered his strength into captivity, </div><div class='q2'>his glory into the adversary’s hand. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>He also gave his people over to the sword, </div><div class='q2'>and was angry with his inheritance. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>Fire devoured their young men. </div><div class='q2'>Their virgins had no wedding song. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#160;</span>Their priests fell by the sword, </div><div class='q2'>and their widows couldn’t weep. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V65">65&#160;</span>Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep, </div><div class='q2'>like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V66">66&#160;</span>He struck his adversaries backward. </div><div class='q2'>He put them to a perpetual reproach. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V67">67&#160;</span>Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph, </div><div class='q2'>and didn’t choose the tribe of Ephraim, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V68">68&#160;</span>But chose the tribe of Judah, </div><div class='q2'>Mount Zion which he loved. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V69">69&#160;</span>He built his sanctuary like the heights, </div><div class='q2'>like the earth which he has established forever. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V70">70&#160;</span>He also chose David his servant, </div><div class='q2'>and took him from the sheepfolds; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V71">71&#160;</span>from following the ewes that have their young, </div><div class='q2'>he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob, his people, </div><div class='q2'>and Israel, his inheritance. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V72">72&#160;</span>So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart, </div><div class='q2'>and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><ul class='tnav'>
