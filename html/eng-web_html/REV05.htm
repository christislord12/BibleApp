Behold, the Lion who is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome: he who opens the book and its seven seals.”  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I saw in the middle of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the middle of the elders, a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent out into all the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then he came, and he took it out of the right hand of him who sat on the throne.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Now when he had taken the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each one having a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>They sang a new song, saying, </div><div class='q'>“You are worthy to take the book </div><div class='q2'>and to open its seals: </div><div class='q'>for you were killed, </div><div class='q2'>and bought us for God with your blood </div><div class='q2'>out of every tribe, language, people, and nation, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>and made us kings and priests to our God, </div><div class='q2'>and we will reign on the earth.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I saw, and I heard something like a voice of many angels around the throne, the living creatures, and the elders.
