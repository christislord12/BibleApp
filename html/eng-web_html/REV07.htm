He cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to harm the earth and the sea,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>saying, “Don’t harm the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, until we have sealed the bondservants of our God on their foreheads!”  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I heard the number of those who were sealed, one hundred forty-four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of the children of Israel: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>of the tribe of Judah twelve thousand were sealed, </div><div class='q'>of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand, </div><div class='q'>of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand, </div><div class='q'>of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand, </div><div class='q'>of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand, </div><div class='q'>of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand, </div><div class='q'>of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand, </div><div class='q'>of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand, and </div><div class='q'>of the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand were sealed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude, which no man could count, out of every nation and of all tribes, peoples, and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, dressed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They cried with a loud voice, saying, “Salvation be to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>All the angels were standing around the throne, the elders, and the four living creatures; and they fell on their faces before his throne, and worshiped God,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>saying, “Amen!

Amen.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>One of the elders answered, saying to me, “These who are arrayed in the white robes, who are they, and where did they come from?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I told him, “My lord, you know.” </div><div class='p'>He said to me, “These are those who came out of the great suffering.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> or, oppression</span></a>They washed their robes, and made them white in the Lamb’s blood.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Therefore they are before the throne of God, they serve him day and night in his temple.
