Much incense was given to him, that he should add it to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar which was before the throne.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel’s hand.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The angel took the censer, and he filled it with the fire of the altar, then threw it on the earth. Thunders, sounds, lightnings, and an earthquake followed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The first sounded, and there followed hail and fire, mixed with blood, and they were thrown to the earth. One third of the earth was burned up, <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> TR omits “One third of the earth was burned up”</span></a> and one third of the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The second angel sounded, and something like a great burning mountain was thrown into the sea. One third of the sea became blood,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>and one third of the living creatures which were in the sea died. One third of the ships were destroyed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The third angel sounded, and a great star fell from the sky, burning like a torch, and it fell on one third of the rivers, and on the springs of the waters.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The name of the star is called “Wormwood.” One third of the waters became wormwood. Many people died from the waters, because they were made bitter. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The fourth angel sounded, and one third of the sun was struck, and one third of the moon, and one third of the stars; so that one third of them would be darkened, and the day wouldn’t shine for one third of it, and the night in the same way.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I saw, and I heard an eagle,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> TR reads “angel” instead of “eagle” </span></a> flying in mid heaven, saying with a loud voice, “Woe! Woe! Woe for those who dwell on the earth, because of the other voices of the trumpets of the three angels, who are yet to sound!” </div><ul class='tnav'>
