The sound which I heard was like that of harpists playing on their harps.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>They sing a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except the one hundred forty-four thousand, those who had been redeemed out of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>These are those who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are those who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These were redeemed by Jesus from among men, the first fruits to God and to the Lamb.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>In their mouth was found no lie, for they are blameless.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> TR adds “before the throne of God”</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I saw an angel flying in mid heaven, having an eternal Good News to proclaim to those who dwell on the earth, and to every nation, tribe, language, and people.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>He said with a loud voice, “Fear the Lord, and give him glory; for the hour of his judgment has come.

He will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever. They have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Here is the perseverance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Write, ‘Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.’ ” </div><div class='p'>“Yes,” says the Spirit, “that they may rest from their labors; for their works follow with them.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I looked, and saw a white cloud, and on the cloud one sitting like a son of man,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Daniel 7:13</span></a> having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud, “Send your sickle, and reap; for the hour to reap has come; for the harvest of the earth is ripe!”  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He who sat on the cloud thrust his sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven.
