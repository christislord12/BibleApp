I will show you the wife, the Lamb’s bride.”  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>having the glory of God. Her light was like a most precious stone, as if it were a jasper stone, clear as crystal;  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>having a great and high wall; having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels; and names written on them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>On the east were three gates; and on the north three gates; and on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He who spoke with me had for a measure a golden reed to measure the city, its gates, and its walls.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The city is square, and its length is as great as its width.
