For in that which you judge another, you condemn yourself. For you who judge practice the same things.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>We know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who practice such things.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Do you think this, O man who judges those who practice such things, and do the same, that you will escape the judgment of God?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Or do you despise the riches of his goodness, forbearance, and patience, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But according to your hardness and unrepentant heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath, revelation, and of the righteous judgment of God;  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>who “will pay back to everyone according to their works:”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Psalm 62:12; Proverbs 24:12</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>to those who by perseverance in well-doing seek for glory, honor, and incorruptibility, eternal life;  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>but to those who are self-seeking, and don’t obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, will be wrath, indignation,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>oppression, and anguish on every soul of man who does evil, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But glory, honor, and peace go to every man who does good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For there is no partiality with God.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For as many as have sinned without the law will also perish without the law. As many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For it isn’t the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be justified  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>(for when Gentiles who don’t have the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are a law to themselves,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience testifying with them, and their thoughts among themselves accusing or else excusing them)  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>in the day when God will judge the secrets of men, according to my Good News, by Jesus Christ. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Indeed you bear the name of a Jew, rest on the law, glory in God,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>know his will, and approve the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babies, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>You therefore who teach another, don’t you teach yourself? You who preach that a man shouldn’t steal, do you steal?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>You who say a man shouldn’t commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>You who glory in the law, do you dishonor God by disobeying the law?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For “the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you,” <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Isaiah 52:5; Ezekiel 36:22</span></a> just as it is written.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For circumcision indeed profits, if you are a doer of the law, but if you are a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>If therefore the uncircumcised keep the ordinances of the law, won’t his uncircumcision be accounted as circumcision?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Won’t the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfills the law, judge you, who with the letter and circumcision are a transgressor of the law?  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh;  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
