Amen. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But it is not as though the word of God has come to nothing.

But, “your offspring will be accounted as from Isaac.”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Genesis 21:12</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as heirs.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For this is a word of promise, “At the appointed time I will come, and Sarah will have a son.”<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Genesis 18:10,14</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Not only so, but Rebekah also conceived by one, by our father Isaac.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For being not yet born, neither having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him who calls,<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> NU puts the phrase “not of works, but of him who calls” at the beginning of verse 12 instead of the end of verse 11.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>it was said to her, “The elder will serve the younger.”<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Genesis 25:23</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Even as it is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Malachi 1:2-3</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>What shall we say then?
