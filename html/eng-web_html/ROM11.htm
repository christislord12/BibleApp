<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 11</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>I ask then, did God reject his people? May it never be! For I also am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>God didn’t reject his people, which he foreknew. Or don’t you know what the Scripture says about Elijah? How he pleads with God against Israel:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>“Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have broken down your altars. I am left alone, and they seek my life.”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> 1 Kings 19:10,14</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But how does God answer him? “I have reserved for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.”<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> 1 Kings 19:18</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And if by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace. But if it is of works, it is no longer grace; otherwise work is no longer work. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>What then? That which Israel seeks for, that he didn’t obtain, but the chosen ones obtained it, and the rest were hardened.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>According as it is written, “God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, to this very day.” <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Deuteronomy 29:4; Isaiah 29:10</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>David says, </div><div class='q'>“Let their table be made a snare, a trap, </div><div class='q2'>a stumbling block, and a retribution to them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see. </div><div class='q2'>Always keep their backs bent.”<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Psalm 69:22,23</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I ask then, did they stumble that they might fall? May it never be! But by their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For I speak to you who are Gentiles. Since then as I am an apostle to Gentiles, I glorify my ministry;  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>if by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh, and may save some of them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For if the rejection of them is the reconciling of the world, what would their acceptance be, but life from the dead?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>If the first fruit is holy, so is the lump. If the root is holy, so are the branches.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them and became partaker with them of the root and of the richness of the olive tree,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>don’t boast over the branches. But if you boast, it is not you who support the root, but the root supports you.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>You will say then, “Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.”  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>True; by their unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by your faith. Don’t be conceited, but fear;  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>for if God didn’t spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>See then the goodness and severity of God. Toward those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness; otherwise you also will be cut off.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>They also, if they don’t continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For if you were cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree, how much more will these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For I don’t desire you to be ignorant, brothers,<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> The word for “brothers” here and where context allows may also be correctly translated “brothers and sisters” or “siblings.”</span></a> of this mystery, so that you won’t be wise in your own conceits, that a partial hardening has happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>and so all Israel will be saved. Even as it is written, </div><div class='q'>“There will come out of Zion the Deliverer, </div><div class='q2'>and he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>This is my covenant with them, </div><div class='q2'>when I will take away their sins.”<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Isaiah 59:20-21; 27:9; Jeremiah 31:33-34</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Concerning the Good News, they are enemies for your sake. But concerning the election, they are beloved for the fathers’ sake.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For as you in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience,  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>even so these also have now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they may also obtain mercy.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>For God has bound all to disobedience, that he might have mercy on all. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God!
