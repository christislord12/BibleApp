Abhor that which is evil. Cling to that which is good.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>In love of the brothers be tenderly affectionate to one another; in honor preferring one another;  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>not lagging in diligence; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>rejoicing in hope; enduring in troubles; continuing steadfastly in prayer;  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>contributing to the needs of the saints; given to hospitality.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Bless those who persecute you; bless, and don’t curse.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Rejoice with those who rejoice. Weep with those who weep.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Be of the same mind one toward another. Don’t set your mind on high things, but associate with the humble. Don’t be wise in your own conceits.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Repay no one evil for evil. Respect what is honorable in the sight of all men.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>If it is possible, as much as it is up to you, be at peace with all men.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Don’t seek revenge yourselves, beloved, but give place to God’s wrath.
