Do you desire to have no fear of the authority? Do that which is good, and you will have praise from the authority,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>for he is a servant of God to you for good. But if you do that which is evil, be afraid, for he doesn’t bear the sword in vain; for he is a servant of God, an avenger for wrath to him who does evil.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Therefore you need to be in subjection, not only because of the wrath, but also for conscience’ sake.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For this reason you also pay taxes, for they are servants of God’s service, continually doing this very thing.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Therefore give everyone what you owe: if you owe taxes, pay taxes; if customs, then customs; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Owe no one anything, except to love one another; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For the commandments, “You shall not commit adultery,” “You shall not murder,” “You shall not steal,”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> TR adds “You shall not give false testimony,”</span></a> “You shall not covet,” <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Exodus 20:13-15,17; Deuteronomy 5:17-19,21</span></a> and whatever other commandments there are, are all summed up in this saying, namely, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Leviticus 19:18</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Love doesn’t harm a neighbor. Love therefore is the fulfillment of the law. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Do this, knowing the time, that it is already time for you to awaken out of sleep, for salvation is now nearer to us than when we first believed.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The night is far gone, and the day is near. Let’s therefore throw off the deeds of darkness, and let’s put on the armor of light.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Let’s walk properly, as in the day; not in reveling and drunkenness, not in sexual promiscuity and lustful acts, and not in strife and jealousy.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, for its lusts. </div><ul class='tnav'>
