<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 2</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Naomi had a relative of her husband’s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, “Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I find favor.” </div><div class='p'>She said to her, “Go, my daughter.”  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>She went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, “May Yahweh be with you.” </div><div class='p'>They answered him, “May Yahweh bless you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then Boaz said to his servant who was set over the reapers, “Whose young lady is this?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The servant who was set over the reapers answered, “It is the Moabite lady who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>She said, ‘Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.’ So she came, and has continued even from the morning until now, except that she rested a little in the house.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen, my daughter. Don’t go to glean in another field, and don’t go from here, but stay here close to my maidens.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Let your eyes be on the field that they reap, and go after them. Haven’t I commanded the young men not to touch you? When you are thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink from that which the young men have drawn.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, “Why have I found favor in your sight, that you should take knowledge of me, since I am a foreigner?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Boaz answered her, “I have been told all about what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, and how you have left your father, your mother, and the land of your birth, and have come to a people that you didn’t know before.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>May Yahweh repay your work, and a full reward be given to you from Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then she said, “Let me find favor in your sight, my lord, because you have comforted me, and because you have spoken kindly to your servant, though I am not as one of your servants.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>At meal time Boaz said to her, “Come here, and eat some bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar.” </div><div class='p'>She sat beside the reapers, and they passed her parched grain. She ate, was satisfied, and left some of it.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>When she had risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, “Let her glean even among the sheaves, and don’t reproach her.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it. Let her glean, and don’t rebuke her.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So she gleaned in the field until evening; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> 1 ephah is about 22 liters or about 2/3 of a bushel</span></a> of barley.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>She took it up, and went into the city. Then her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned; and she brought out and gave to her that which she had left after she had enough. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Her mother-in-law said to her, “Where have you gleaned today? Where have you worked? Blessed be he who noticed you.” </div><div class='p'>She told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, “The man’s name with whom I worked today is Boaz.”  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “May he be blessed by Yahweh, who has not abandoned his kindness to the living and to the dead.” Naomi said to her, “The man is a close relative to us, one of our near kinsmen.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Ruth the Moabitess said, “Yes, he said to me, ‘You shall stay close to my young men until they have finished all my harvest.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, “It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maidens, and that they not meet you in any other field.”  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>So she stayed close to the maidens of Boaz, to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she lived with her mother-in-law. </div><ul class='tnav'>
