</div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>In the shaking of a sieve, the refuse remains; </div><div class='q'>So the filth of man in his reasoning. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The furnace will prove the potter’s vessels; </div><div class='q'>And the trial of a man is in his reasoning. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The fruit of a tree declares the husbandry thereof; </div><div class='q'>So is the utterance of the thought of the heart of a man. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Praise no man before <span class='add'>you hear him </span> reason; </div><div class='q'>For this is the trial of men. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>If you follow righteousness, you will obtain her, </div><div class='q'>And put her on, as a long robe of glory. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Birds will return to their like;

</div><div class='q'>But stay continually among the thoughtful. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The discourse of fools is an offence; </div><div class='q'>And their laughter is in the wantonness of sin. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The talk of a man of many oaths will make the hair stand upright; </div><div class='q'>And their strife makes one stop his ears. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The strife of the proud is a shedding of blood; </div><div class='q'>And their reviling of each other is a grievous thing to hear. </div><div class='b'> &#160;
