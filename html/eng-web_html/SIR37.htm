<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 37</div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Every friend will say, I also am his friend: </div><div class='q'>But there is a friend, which is only a friend in name. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Is there not a grief in it even to death, </div><div class='q'>When a companion and friend is turned to enmity? </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>O wicked imagination, whence came you rolling in </div><div class='q'>To cover the dry land with deceitfulness? </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>There is a companion, which rejoices in the gladness of a friend, </div><div class='q'>But in time of affliction will be against him. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>There is a companion, which for the belly’s sake labors with his friend, </div><div class='q'>In the face of battle will take up the buckler. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Forget not a friend in your soul; </div><div class='q'>And be not unmindful of him in your riches. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Every counselor extols counsel; </div><div class='q'>But there is that counsels for himself. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Let your soul beware of a counselor, </div><div class='q'>And know you before what is his interest </div><div class='q'>(For he will take counsel for himself); </div><div class='q'>Lest he cast the lot upon you, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And say to you, Your way is good: </div><div class='q'>And he will stand near you, to see what will happen to you. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Take not counsel with one that looks askance at you; </div><div class='q'>And hide your counsel from such as are jealous of you. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> <span class='add'>Take not counsel </span> with a woman about her rival; </div><div class='q'>Neither with a coward about war; </div><div class='q'>Nor with a merchant about exchange; </div><div class='q'>Nor with a buyer about selling; </div><div class='q'>Nor with an envious man about thankfulness; </div><div class='q'>Nor with an unmerciful man about kindliness; </div><div class='q'>Nor with a sluggard about any kind of work; </div><div class='q'>Nor with a hireling in your house about finishing <span class='add'>his work; </span> </div><div class='q'>Nor with an idle servant about much business: </div><div class='q'>Give not heed to these in any matter of counsel. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But rather be continually with a godly man, </div><div class='q'>Whom you shall have known to be a keeper of the commandments, </div><div class='q'>Who in his soul is as your own soul, </div><div class='q'>And who will grieve with you, if you shall miscarry. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And make the counsel of your heart to stand; </div><div class='q'>For there is none more faithful to you than it. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For a man’s soul is sometimes wont to bring him tidings, </div><div class='q'>More than seven watchmen that sit on high on a watch-tower. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And above all this entreat the Most High, </div><div class='q'>That he may direct your way in truth. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Let reason be the beginning of every work, </div><div class='q'>And let counsel go before every action. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>As a token of the changing of the heart, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>four manner of things do rise up, </div><div class='q'>Good and evil, life and death; </div><div class='q'>And that which rules over them continually is the tongue. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>There is one that is shrewd <span class='add'>and </span> the instructor of many, </div><div class='q'>And yet is unprofitable to his own soul. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>There is <span class='add'>one </span> that is subtle in words, and is hated; </div><div class='q'>He shall be destitute of all food: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For grace was not given him from the Lord; </div><div class='q'>Because he is deprived of all wisdom. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>There is one that is wise to his own soul; </div><div class='q'>And the fruits of his understanding are trustworthy in the mouth. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>A wise man will instruct his own people; </div><div class='q'>And the fruits of his understanding are trustworthy. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>A wise man shall be filled with blessing; </div><div class='q'>And all those who see him shall call him happy. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The life of man is counted by days; </div><div class='q'>And the days of Israel are innumerable. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>The wise man shall inherit confidence among his people, </div><div class='q'>And his name shall live forever. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>My son, prove your soul in your life, </div><div class='q'>And see what is evil for it, and give not that to it. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For all things are not profitable for all men, </div><div class='q'>Neither has every soul pleasure in every thing. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Be not insatiable in any luxury, </div><div class='q'>And be not greedy on the things that you eatest. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For in multitude of meats there shall be disease, </div><div class='q'>And surfeiting shall come near to colic. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Because of surfeiting have many perished;
