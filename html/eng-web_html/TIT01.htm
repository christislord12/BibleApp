For this cause, reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>They profess that they know God, but by their deeds they deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work. </div><ul class='tnav'>
