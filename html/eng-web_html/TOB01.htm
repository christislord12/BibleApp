Compare 2 Kings 17:3, 23. </span></a> king of the Assyrians was carried away captive out of Thisbe, which is on the right hand of Kedesh Naphtali in Galilee above Asher. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I, Tobit walked in the ways of truth and righteousness all the days of my life, and I did many alms deeds to my kindred and my nation, who went with me into the land of the Assyrians, to Nineveh.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>When I was in my own country, in the land of Israel, while I was yet young, all the tribe of Naphtali my father fell away from the house of Jerusalem, which was chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, that all the tribes should sacrifice there, and the temple of the habitation of the Most High was hallowed and built therein for all ages.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>All the tribes which fell away together sacrificed to the heifer Baal, and so did the house of Naphtali my father.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I alone went often to Jerusalem at the feasts, as it has been ordained to all Israel by an everlasting decree, having the first fruits and the tenths of my increase, and that which was first shorn; and I gave them at the altar to the priests the sons of Aaron.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I gave a tenth part of all my increase to the sons of Levi, who ministered at Jerusalem. A second tenth part I sold away, and went, and spent it each year at Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>A third tenth I gave to them to whom it was appropriate, as Deborah my father’s mother had commanded me, because I was left an orphan by my father.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>When I became a man, I took as wife Anna of the seed of our own family. With her, I became the father of Tobias.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>When I was carried away captive to Nineveh, all my kindred and my relatives ate of the bread of the Gentiles;  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>but I kept myself from eating,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>because I remembered God with all my soul.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So the Most High gave me grace and favor<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. beauty. </span></a> in the sight of Enemessar, and I was his purchasing agent.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And I went into Media, and left ten talents of silver in trust with Gabael, the brother of Gabrias, at Rages of Media. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And when Enemessar was dead, Sennacherib his son reigned in his place. In his time, the highways were troubled,<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. his highways were troubled. </span></a> and I could no longer go into Media.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>In the days of Enemessar, I did many alms deeds to my kindred: I gave my bread to the hungry,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>and my garments to the naked. If I saw any of my race dead, and thrown out on<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Some ancient authorities read behind. </span></a> the wall of Ninevah, I buried him.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>If Sennacherib the king killed any, when he came fleeing from Judea, I buried them privately; for in his wrath he killed many; and the bodies were sought for by the king, and were not found.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But one of the Ninevites went and showed to the king concerning me, how I buried them, and hid myself; and when I knew that I was sought for to be put to death, I withdrew myself for fear.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And all my goods were forcibly taken away, and there was nothing left to me, save my wife Anna and my son Tobias.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>No more than fifty five days passed before two of his sons killed him, and they fled into the mountains of Ararat. And Sarchedonus<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> That is, Esar-haddon, and so in verse 22. </span></a> his son reigned in his place; and he appointed Achiacharus my brother Anael’s son over all the accounts of his kingdom, and over all his affairs.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Achiacharus requested me, and I came to Nineveh. Now Achiacharus was cupbearer, keeper of the signet, steward, and overseer of the accounts. Sarchedonus appointed him next to himself, but he was my brother’s son. </div><ul class='tnav'>
