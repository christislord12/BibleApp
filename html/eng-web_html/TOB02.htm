Behold, I wait for you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then he came, and said, “Father, one of our race is strangled, and has been cast out in the marketplace.”  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Before I had tasted anything, I sprang up, and took him up into a chamber until the sun had set.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then I returned, washed myself, ate my bread in heaviness,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>and remembered the prophecy of Amos, as he said, </div><div class='q'><a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Amos 8:10</span></a>“Your feasts will be turned into mourning, </div><div class='q2'>and all your mirth into lamentation. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So I wept: and when the sun had set, I went and dug a grave, and buried him.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>My neighbors mocked me, and said, “He is no longer afraid to be put to death for this matter; and yet he fled away. Behold, he buries the dead again.”  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The same night I returned from burying him, and slept by the wall of my courtyard, being polluted; and my face was uncovered.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I didn’t know that there were sparrows in the wall. My eyes were open and the sparrows dropped warm dung into my eyes, and white films came over my eyes. I went to the physicians, and they didn’t help me; but Achiacharus nourished me, until I went<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Some authorities read until he went. </span></a> into Elymais. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>My wife Anna wove cloth in the women’s chambers,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>and sent the work back to the owners. They on their part paid her wages, and also gave her a kid.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But when it came to my house, it began to cry, and I said to her, Where did this kid come from? Is it stolen? Give it back to the owners; for it is not lawful to eat anything that is stolen.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But she said, “It has been given to me for a gift more than the wages.” </div><div class='p'>I didn’t believe her, and I asked her to return it to the owners; and I was ashamed of her. </div><div class='p'>But she answered and said to me, “Where are your alms and your righteous deeds?
