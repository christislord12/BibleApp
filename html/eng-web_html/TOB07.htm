<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 7</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>They came to Ecbatana, and arrived at the house of Raguel. But Sarah met them; and she greeted them, and they her. Then she brought them into the house.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Raguel said to Edna his wife, “This young man really resembles Tobit my cousin!”  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And Raguel asked them, “Where are you two from, kindred?” </div><div class='p'>They said to him, “We are of the sons of Naphtali, who are captives in Nineveh.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>He said to them, “Do you know Tobit our brother?” </div><div class='p'>They said, “We know him.” </div><div class='p'>Then he said to them, “Is he in good health?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>They said, “He is both alive, and in good health.” Tobias said, “He is my father.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Raguel sprang up, and kissed him, wept,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>blessed him, and said to him, “You are the son of an honest and good man.” When he had heard that Tobit had lost his sight, he was grieved, and wept;  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>and Edna his wife and Sarah his daughter wept. They received them gladly; and they killed a ram of the flock, and served them meat. </div><div class='p'>But Tobias said to Raphael, “Brother Azarias, speak of those things of which you talked about in the way, and let the matter be finished.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So he communicated the thing to Raguel. Raguel said to Tobias, “Eat, drink, and make merry:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>for it belongs to you to take my child. However I will tell you the truth.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I have given my child to seven men, and whenever they came in to her, they died in the night. But for the present be merry.” </div><div class='p'>And Tobias said, “I will taste nothing here, until you all make a covenant and enter into that covenant with me.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Raguel said, “Take her to yourself from now on according to custom. You are her relative, and she is yours. The merciful God will give all good success to you.”  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And he called his daughter Sarah, and took her by the hand, and gave her to be wife of Tobias, and said, “Behold, take her to yourself after the law of Moses, and lead her away to your father.” And he blessed them.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He called Edna his wife, then took a book, wrote a contract, and sealed it.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then they began to eat. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Raguel called his wife Edna, and said to her, “Sister, prepare the other chamber, and bring her in there.”  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>She did as he asked her, and brought her in there. She wept, and she received the tears of her daughter, and said to her,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>“Be comforted, my child. May the Lord of heaven and earth give you favor<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Many ancient authorities read joy. </span></a> for this your sorrow.
