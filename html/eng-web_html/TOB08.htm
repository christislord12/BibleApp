<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 8</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>When they had finished their supper, they brought Tobias in to her.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>But as he went, he remembered the words of Raphael, and took the ashes of the incense, and put the heart and the liver of the fish on them, and made smoke with them.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>When the demon smelled that smell, it fled into the uppermost parts of Egypt, and the angel bound him.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But after they were both shut in together, Tobias rose up from the bed, and said, “Sister, arise, and let’s pray that the Lord may have mercy on us.”  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And Tobias began to say, “Blessed are you, O God of our fathers, and blessed is your holy and glorious name forever. Let the heavens bless you, and all your creatures.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>You made Adam, and gave him Eve his wife for a helper and support. From them came the seed of men. You said, it is not good that the man should be alone. Let’s make him a helper like him.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And now, O Lord, I take not this my sister for lust, but in truth. Command that I may find mercy and grow old with her.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>She said with him, “Amen.” And they both slept that night. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Raguel arose, and went and dug a grave,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>saying, “Lest he also should die.”  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Raguel came into his house,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>and said to Edna his wife, “Send one of the maidservants, and let them see if he is alive. If not, we will bury him, and no man will know it.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So the maidservant opened the door, and went in, and found them both sleeping,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>and came out, and told them that he was alive. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then Raguel blessed God, saying, “Blessed are you, O God, with all pure and holy blessing! Let your saints bless you, and all your creatures! Let all your angels and your elect bless you forever!  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Blessed are you, because you have made me glad; and it has not happened to me as I suspected; but you have dealt with us according to your great mercy.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Blessed are you, because you have had mercy on two that were the only begotten children of their parents. Show them mercy, O Lord. Fulfill their life in health with gladness and mercy. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>He commanded his servants to fill the grave.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>He kept the wedding feast for them fourteen days.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Before the days of the wedding feast were finished, Raguel sware to him, that he should not depart till the fourteen days of the wedding feast were fulfilled;  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>and that then he should take half of his goods, and go in safety to his father; and the rest, said he, when my wife and I die. </div><ul class='tnav'>
