<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 14</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then Tobit finished giving thanks.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>He was fifty-eight years old when he lost his sight. After eight years, he received it again. He gave alms and he feared the Lord God more and more, and gave thanks to him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Now he grew very old; and he called his son with the six sons of his son, and said to him, “My child, take your sons. Behold, I have grown old, and am ready to depart out of this life.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Go into Media, my child, for I surely believe all the things which Jonah the prophet spoke of Nineveh, that it will be overthrown, but in Media there will rather be peace for a season. Our kindred will be scattered in the earth from the good land. Jerusalem will be desolate, and the house of God in it will be burned up, and will be desolate for a time.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>God will again have mercy on them, and bring them back into the land, and they will build the house, but not like to the former house, until the times of that age are fulfilled. Afterward they will return from the places of their captivity, and build up Jerusalem with honor. The house of God will be built in it forever with a glorious building, even as the prophets spoke concerning it.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And all the nations will turn to fear the Lord God truly, and will bury their idols.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>All the nations will bless the Lord, and his people will give thanks to God, and the Lord will exalt his people; and all those who love the Lord God in truth and righteousness will rejoice, showing mercy to our kindred.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And now, my child, depart from Nineveh, because those things which the prophet Jonah spoke will surely come to pass.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But you must keep the law and the ordinances, and show yourself merciful and righteous, that it may be well with you.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Bury me decently, and your mother with me. Don’t stay at Nineveh. See, my child, what Aman did to Achiacharus that nourished him, how out of light he brought him into darkness, and all the recompense that he made him. Achiacharus was saved, but the other had his recompense, and he went down into darkness. Manasses gave alms, and escaped the snare of death which he set for him; but Aman fell into the snare, and perished.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And now, my children, consider what alms does, and how righteousness delivers.” </div><div class='p'>While he was saying these things, he gave up the ghost in the bed; but he was one hundred fifty eight years old. Tobias buried him magnificently.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>When Anna died, he buried her with his father. But Tobias departed with his wife and his sons to Ecbatana to Raguel his father-in-law,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>and he grew old in honor, and he buried his father-in-law and mother-in-law magnificently, and he inherited their possessions, and his father Tobit’s.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He died at Ecbatana of Media, being one hundred twenty seven years old.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Before he died, he heard of the destruction of Nineveh, which Nebuchadnezzar and Ahasuerus took captive. Before his death, he rejoiced over Nineveh. </div><ul class='tnav'>
