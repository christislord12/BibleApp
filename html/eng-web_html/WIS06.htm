</div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>because being officers of his kingdom, you didn’t judge rightly, </div><div class='q2'>nor did you keep<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Or, the law </span></a> law, </div><div class='q2'>nor did you walk according to God’s counsel. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>He will come upon you awfully and swiftly, </div><div class='q2'>because a stern judgement comes on those who are in high place. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For the man of low estate may be pardoned in mercy, </div><div class='q2'>but mighty men will be mightily tested. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For the Sovereign Lord of all will not be impressed with anyone, </div><div class='q2'>neither will he show deference to greatness; </div><div class='q'>because it is he who made both small and great, </div><div class='q2'>and cares about them all; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>but the scrutiny that comes upon the powerful is strict. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Therefore, my words are to you, O princes, </div><div class='q2'>that you may learn wisdom and not fall away. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For those who have kept the things that are holy in holiness will be made holy. </div><div class='q2'>Those who have been taught them will find what to say in defense. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Therefore set your desire on my words. </div><div class='q2'>Long for them, and you princes will be instructed. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Wisdom is radiant and doesn’t fade away; </div><div class='q2'>and is easily seen by those who love her, </div><div class='q2'>and found by those who seek her. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>She anticipates those who desire her, making herself known. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He who rises up early to seek her won’t have difficulty, </div><div class='q2'>for he will find her sitting at his gates. </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For to think upon her is perfection of understanding, </div><div class='q2'>and he who watches for her will quickly be free from care; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>because she herself goes around, seeking those who are worthy of her, </div><div class='q2'>and in their paths she appears to them graciously, </div><div class='q2'>and in every purpose she meets them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For her true beginning is desire for instruction; </div><div class='q2'>and desire for instruction is love. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And love is observance of her laws. </div><div class='q2'>To give heed to her laws confirms immortality. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Immortality brings closeness to God. </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>So then desire for wisdom promotes to a kingdom. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>If therefore you delight in thrones and sceptres, you princes of peoples, </div><div class='q2'>honor wisdom, that you may reign forever. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But what wisdom is, and how she came into being, I will declare. </div><div class='q2'>I won’t hide mysteries from you; </div><div class='q2'>but I will explore from her first beginning, </div><div class='q2'>bring the knowledge of her into clear light, </div><div class='q2'>and I will not pass by the truth. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Indeed, I won’t go with consuming envy, </div><div class='q2'>because envy will have no fellowship with wisdom. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But a multitude of wise men is salvation to the world, </div><div class='q2'>and an understanding king is stability for his people. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Therefore be instructed by my words, and you will profit. </div><ul class='tnav'>
