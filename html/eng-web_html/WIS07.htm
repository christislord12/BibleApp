</div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>but all men have one entrance into life, and a common departure. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For this cause I prayed, and understanding was given to me. </div><div class='q2'>I asked a spirit of wisdom came to me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I preferred her before sceptres and thrones. </div><div class='q2'>I considered riches nothing in comparison to her. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Neither did I liken to her any priceless gem, </div><div class='q2'>because all gold in her presence is a little sand, </div><div class='q2'>and silver will be considered as clay before her. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I loved her more than health and beauty, </div><div class='q2'>and I chose to have her rather than light, </div><div class='q2'>because her bright shining is never laid to sleep. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>All good things came to me with her, </div><div class='q2'>and innumerable riches are in her hands. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And I rejoiced over them all because wisdom leads them; </div><div class='q2'>although I didn’t know that she was their mother. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>As I learned without guile, I impart without grudging. </div><div class='q2'>I don’t hide her riches. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For she is a treasure for men that doesn’t fail, </div><div class='q2'>and those who use it obtain friendship with God, </div><div class='q2'>commended by the gifts which they present through discipline. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But may God grant that I may speak his judgement, </div><div class='q2'>and to conceive thoughts worthy of what has been given me; </div><div class='q2'>because he is one who guides even wisdom and who corrects the wise. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For both we and our words are in his hand, </div><div class='q2'>with all understanding and skill in various crafts. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For he himself gave me an unerring knowledge of the things that are, </div><div class='q2'>to know the structure of the universe and the operation of the elements;

</div><div class='q'>For there is in her a spirit that is quick to understand, holy, </div><div class='q2'>unique, manifold, subtle, freely moving, clear in utterance, unpolluted, </div><div class='q2'>distinct, unharmed, loving what is good, keen, unhindered, </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>beneficent, loving toward man, steadfast, sure, free from care, all-powerful, all-surveying, </div><div class='q2'>and penetrating through all spirits that are quick to understand, pure, most subtle: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For wisdom is more mobile than any motion. </div><div class='q2'>Yes, she pervades and penetrates all things by reason of her purity. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For she is a breath of the power of God, </div><div class='q2'>and a clear effluence of the glory of the Almighty. </div><div class='q'>Therefore nothing defiled can find entrance into her. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For she is a reflection of everlasting light, </div><div class='q2'>an unspotted mirror of the working of God, </div><div class='q2'>and an image of his goodness. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>She, being one, has power to do all things. </div><div class='q2'>Remaining in herself, she renews all things. </div><div class='q'>From generation to generation passing into holy souls, </div><div class='q2'>she makes friends of God and prophets. </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For God loves nothing as much as one who dwells with wisdom. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For she is fairer than the sun, </div><div class='q2'>and above all the constellations of the stars. </div><div class='q2'>She is better than light. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For daylight succeeds night, </div><div class='q2'>but evil does not prevail against wisdom. </div><ul class='tnav'>
