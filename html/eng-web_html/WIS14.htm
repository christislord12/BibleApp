</div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>but the idol made with hands is accursed, itself and he that made it; </div><div class='q2'>because his was the working, and the corruptible thing was called a god: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For both the ungodly and his ungodliness are alike hateful to God; </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>for truly the deed will be punished together with him who committed it. </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Therefore also there will be a visitation among the idols of the nation, </div><div class='q2'>because, though formed of things which God created, they were made an abomination, </div><div class='q2'>stumbling blocks to the souls of men, </div><div class='q2'>and a snare to the feet of the foolish. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For the devising of idols was the beginning of fornication, </div><div class='q2'>and the invention of them the corruption of life. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For they didn’t exist from the beginning, and they won’t exist forever. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For by the vaingloriousness of men they entered into the world, </div><div class='q2'>and therefore was a speedy end is planned for them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For a father worn with untimely grief, </div><div class='q2'>making an image of the child quickly taken away, </div><div class='q2'>now honored him as a god which was then a dead man, </div><div class='q2'>and delivered to those that were under him mysteries and solemn rites. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Afterward the ungodly custom, in process of time grown strong, was kept as a law, </div><div class='q2'>and the engraved images received worship by the commandments of princes. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And when men could not honor them in presence because they lived far off, </div><div class='q2'>imagining the likeness from afar, </div><div class='q2'>they made a visible image of the king whom they honored, </div><div class='q2'>that by their zeal they might flatter the absent as if present. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But worship was raised to a yet higher pitch, even by those who didn’t know him, </div><div class='q2'>urged forward by the ambition of the architect; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>for he, wishing perhaps to please one in authority, </div><div class='q2'>used his art to force the likeness toward a greater beauty. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>So the multitude, allured by reason of the grace of his handiwork, </div><div class='q2'>now consider an object of devotion him that a little before was honored as a man. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And this became an ambush, </div><div class='q2'>because men, in bondage either to calamity or to tyranny, </div><div class='q2'>invested stones and stocks with the incommunicable Name. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Afterward it was not enough for them to go astray concerning the knowledge of God; </div><div class='q2'>but also, while they live in a great war of ignorance that they call a multitude of evils peace. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For either slaughtering children in solemn rites, or celebrating secret mysteries, </div><div class='q2'>or holding frantic revels of strange ordinances, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>no longer do they guard either life or purity of marriage, </div><div class='q2'>but one brings upon another either death by treachery, or anguish by adultery. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And all things confusedly are filled with blood and murder, theft and deceit, </div><div class='q2'>corruption, faithlessness, tumult, perjury, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>confusion about what is good, forgetfulness of favors, </div><div class='q2'>ingratitude for benefits, </div><div class='q2'>defiling of souls, confusion of sex, </div><div class='q2'>disorder in marriage, adultery and wantonness. </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For the worship of idols that may not be named <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Exodus 23:13;
