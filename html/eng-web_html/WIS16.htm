<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 16</div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>For this cause, they were deservedly punished through creatures like those which they worship, </div><div class='q2'>and tormented through a multitude of vermin. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Instead of this punishment, you, giving benefits to your people, </div><div class='q2'>prepared quails for food, </div><div class='q'>a delicacy to satisfy the desire of their appetite, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>to the end that your enemies, desiring food, </div><div class='q2'>might for the hideousness of the creatures sent among them, </div><div class='q2'>loathe even the necessary appetite; </div><div class='q'>but these, your people, having for a short time suffered lack, </div><div class='q2'>might even partake of delicacies. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For it was necessary that inescapable lack should come upon those oppressors, </div><div class='q2'>but that to these it should only be showed how their enemies were tormented. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For even when terrible raging of wild beasts came upon your people, </div><div class='q2'>and they were perishing by the bites of crooked serpents, </div><div class='q2'>your wrath didn’t continue to the uttermost; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>but for admonition were they troubled for a short time, </div><div class='q2'>having a token of salvation </div><div class='q2'>to put them in remembrance of the commandment of your law; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>for he who turned toward it was not saved because of that which was seen, </div><div class='q2'>but because of you, the Savior of all. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Yes, and in this you persuaded our enemies </div><div class='q2'>that you are he who delivers out of every evil. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For the bites of locusts and flies truly killed them. </div><div class='q2'>No healing for their life was found, </div><div class='q2'>because they were worthy to be punished by such things. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But your children weren’t overcome by the very teeth of venomous dragons, </div><div class='q2'>for your mercy passed by where they were and healed them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For they were bitten to put them in remembrance of your oracles, </div><div class='q2'>and were quickly saved, lest, falling into deep forgetfulness, </div><div class='q2'>they should become unable to respond to your kindness. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For truly it was neither herb nor mollifying plaster that cured them, </div><div class='q2'>but your word, O Lord, which heals all things. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For you have authority over life and death, </div><div class='q2'>and you lead down to the gates of Hades, and lead up again. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But though a man kills by his wickedness, </div><div class='q2'>he can’t retrieve the spirit that has departed </div><div class='q2'>or release the soul the imprisoned soul. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But it is not possible to escape your hand; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>for ungodly men, refusing to know you, were scourged in the strength of your arm, </div><div class='q2'>pursued with strange rains and hails and relentless storms, </div><div class='q2'>and utterly consumed with fire. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For, what was most marvelous, </div><div class='q2'>in the water which quenches all things, the fire burned hotter; </div><div class='q2'>for the world fights for the righteous. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For at one time the flame lost its fierceness, </div><div class='q2'>that it might not burn up the creatures sent against the ungodly, </div><div class='q2'>but that these themselves as they looked might see that they were chased through the judgement of God. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>At another time even in the midst of water it burns above the power of fire, </div><div class='q2'>that it may destroy the products fruits of an unrighteous land. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Instead of these things, you gave your people angels’ food to eat, </div><div class='q2'>and you provided ready-to-eat bread for them from heaven without toil, </div><div class='q2'>having the virtue of every pleasant flavor, </div><div class='q2'>and agreeable to every taste. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For your nature showed your sweetness toward your children, </div><div class='q2'>while that bread, serving the desire of the eater, </div><div class='q2'>changed itself according to every man’s choice. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But snow and ice endured fire, and didn’t melt, </div><div class='q2'>that people might know that fire was destroying the fruits of the enemies, </div><div class='q2'>burning in the hail and flashing in the rains; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>and that this fire again, in order that righteous people may be nourished, </div><div class='q2'>has even forgotten its own power. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For the creation, ministering to you its maker, </div><div class='q2'>strains its force against the unrighteous for punishment </div><div class='q2'>and slackens it on behalf of those who trust in you, for kindness. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Therefore at that time also, converting itself into all forms, </div><div class='q2'>it ministered to your all-nourishing bounty, </div><div class='q2'>according to the desire of those who had need, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>that your sons, whom you loved, O Lord, might learn </div><div class='q2'>that it is not the growth of crops that nourishes a man, </div><div class='q2'>but that your word preserves those who trust you. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For that which was not marred by fire, </div><div class='q2'>when it was simply warmed by a faint sunbeam melted away, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>that it might be known that we must rise before the sun to give you thanks, </div><div class='q2'>and must plead with you at the dawning of the light; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>for the hope of the unthankful will melt as the winter’s hoar frost, </div><div class='q2'>and will flow away as water that has no use. </div><div class='b'> &#160;
