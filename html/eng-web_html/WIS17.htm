<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 17</div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>For your judgments are great, and hard to interpret; </div><div class='q2'>therefore undisciplined souls went astray. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>For when lawless men had supposed that they held a holy nation in their power, </div><div class='q2'>they, prisoners of darkness, and bound in the fetters of a long night, </div><div class='q2'>kept close beneath their roofs, </div><div class='q2'>lay exiled from the eternal providence. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For while they thought that they were unseen in <span class='add'>their </span> secret sins, </div><div class='q2'>they were divided from one another by a dark curtain of forgetfulness, </div><div class='q2'>stricken with terrible awe, and very troubled by apparitions. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For neither did the dark recesses that held them guard them from fears, </div><div class='q2'>But terrifying sounds rang around them, </div><div class='q2'>and dismal phantoms appeared with unsmiling faces. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And no force of fire prevailed to give light, </div><div class='q2'>neither were the brightest flames of the stars strong enough to illuminate that gloomy night; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>but only the glimmering of a self-kindled fire appeared to them, full of fear. </div><div class='q2'>In terror, they considered the things which they saw </div><div class='q2'>to be worse than that sight, on which they could not gaze. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> The mockeries of their magic arts were powerless, now, </div><div class='q2'>and a shameful rebuke of their boasted understanding: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For those who promised to drive away terrors and disorders from a sick soul, </div><div class='q2'>these were sick with a ludicrous fearfulness. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For even if no troubling thing frighted them, </div><div class='q2'>yet, scared with the creeping of vermin and hissing of serpents, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>they perished trembling in fear, </div><div class='q2'>refusing even to look at the air, which could not be escaped on any side. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> For wickedness, condemned by a witness within, is a coward thing, </div><div class='q2'>and, being pressed hard by conscience, always has added forecasts of the worst. </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For fear is nothing else but a surrender of the help which reason offers; </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>and from within, the expectation of being less </div><div class='q2'>makes of greater account the ignorance of the cause that brings the torment. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But they, all through the night which was powerless indeed, </div><div class='q2'>and which came upon them out of the recesses of powerless Hades, </div><div class='q2'>sleeping the same sleep, </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>now were haunted by monstrous apparitions, </div><div class='q2'>and now were paralyzed by their soul’s surrendering; </div><div class='q2'>for sudden and unexpected fear came upon them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So then whoever it might be, sinking down in his place, </div><div class='q2'>was kept captive, shut up in that prison which was not barred with iron; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>for whether he was a farmer, or a shepherd, </div><div class='q2'>or a laborer whose toils were in the wilderness, </div><div class='q2'>he was overtaken, and endured that inevitable necessity; </div><div class='q2'>for they were all bound with one chain of darkness. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Whether there was a whistling wind, </div><div class='q2'>or a melodious sound of birds among the spreading branches, </div><div class='q2'>or a measured fall of water running violently, </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>or a harsh crashing of rocks hurled down, </div><div class='q2'>or the swift course of animals bounding along unseen, </div><div class='q2'>or the voice of wild beasts harshly roaring, </div><div class='q2'>or an echo rebounding from the hollows of the mountains, </div><div class='q2'>all these things paralyzed them with terror. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For the whole world was illuminated with clear light, </div><div class='q2'>and was occupied with unhindered works, </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>while over them alone was spread a heavy night, </div><div class='q2'>an image of the darkness that should afterward receive them; </div><div class='q2'>but to themselves, they were heavier than darkness. </div><ul class='tnav'>
