<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 18</div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>But for your holy ones there was great light. </div><div class='q2'>Their enemies, hearing their voice but seeing not their form, </div><div class='q2'>counted it a happy thing that they too had suffered, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>fet for that they do not hurt them, though wronged by them before, they are thankful; </div><div class='q2'>and because they had been at variance with them, they begged for pardon. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Whereas you provided a burning pillar of fire, </div><div class='q2'>to be a guide for your people’s unknown journey, </div><div class='q2'>and a harmless sun for their glorious exile. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For the Egyptians well deserved to be deprived of light and imprisoned by darkness, </div><div class='q2'>they who had imprisoned your children, </div><div class='q2'>through whom the incorruptible light of the law was to be given to the race of men. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>After they had taken counsel to kill the babes of the holy ones, </div><div class='q2'>and when a single child had been abandoned and saved to convict them of their sin, </div><div class='q2'>you took away from them their multitude of children, </div><div class='q2'>and destroyed all their army together in a mighty flood. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Our fathers were made aware of that night beforehand, </div><div class='q2'>that, having sure knowledge, they might be cheered by the oaths which they had trusted. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Salvation of the righteous and destruction of the enemies was expected by your people. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For as you took vengeance on the adversaries, </div><div class='q2'>by the same means, calling us to yourself, you glorified us. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For holy children of good men offered sacrifice in secret, </div><div class='q2'>and with one consent they took upon themselves the covenant of the divine law, </div><div class='q2'>that they would partake alike in the same good things and the same perils, </div><div class='q2'>the fathers already leading the sacred songs of praise. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But the discordant cry of the enemies echoed back, </div><div class='q2'>and a pitiful voice of lamentation for children was spread abroad. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Both servant and master were punished with the same just doom, </div><div class='q2'>and the commoner suffering the same as king; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Yes, they all together, under one form of death, </div><div class='q2'>had corpses without number. </div><div class='q'>For the living were not sufficient even to bury them, </div><div class='q2'>Since at a single stroke, their most cherished offspring was consumed. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For while they were disbelieving all things by reason of the enchantments, </div><div class='q2'>upon the destruction of the firstborn they confessed the people to be God’s son. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For while peaceful silence wrapped all things, </div><div class='q2'>and night in her own swiftness was in mid course, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>your all-powerful word leaped from heaven out of the royal thrones, </div><div class='q2'>a stern warrior, into the midst of the doomed land, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>bearing as a sharp sword your authentic commandment, </div><div class='q2'>and standing, it filled all things with death, </div><div class='q2'>and while it touched the heaven it stood upon the earth. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then immediately apparitions in dreams terribly troubled them, </div><div class='q2'>and unexpected fears came upon them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And each, one thrown here half dead, another there, </div><div class='q2'>made known why he was dying; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>for the dreams, disturbing them, did forewarned them of this, </div><div class='q2'>that they might not perish without knowing why they were afflicted. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But experience of death also touched the righteous, </div><div class='q2'>and a multitude were destroyed in the wilderness, </div><div class='q2'>however the wrath didn’t last long. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For a blameless man hurried to be their champion, </div><div class='q2'>bringing the weapon of his own ministry, </div><div class='q2'>prayer and the atoning sacrifice of incense, </div><div class='q2'>he withstood the indignation, and set an end to the calamity, </div><div class='q2'>showing that he was your servant. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And he overcame the anger, </div><div class='q2'>not by strength of body, not by force of weapons, </div><div class='q2'>but he subdued him who was punishing by word, </div><div class='q2'>by bringing to remembrance oaths and covenants made with the fathers. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For when the dead had already fallen in heaps one upon another, </div><div class='q2'>standing between he stopped the wrath, </div><div class='q2'>and cut off the way to the living. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For the whole world was upon his long robe, </div><div class='q2'>and the glories of the fathers were upon the engraving of the four rows of precious stones, </div><div class='q2'>and your majesty was upon the diadem of his head. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The destroyer yielded to these, and they feared; </div><div class='q2'>for it was enough only to test the wrath. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><ul class='tnav'>
