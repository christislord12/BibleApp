<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 19</div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>But indignation without mercy came upon the ungodly to the end; </div><div class='q2'>For God also foreknew their future, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>how, having changed their minds to let your people go, </div><div class='q2'>and having sped them eagerly on their way, </div><div class='q2'>they would change their minds and pursue them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For while they were yet in the midst of their mourning, </div><div class='q2'>and lamenting at the graves of the dead, </div><div class='q2'>they drew upon themselves another counsel of folly, </div><div class='q2'>and pursued as fugitives those whom they had begged to leave and driven out. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For the doom which they deserved was drawing them to this end, </div><div class='q2'>and it made them forget the things that had happened to them, </div><div class='q2'>that they might fill up the punishment which was yet lacking to their torments, </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>and that your people might journey on by a marvelous road, </div><div class='q2'>but they themselves might find a strange death. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For the whole creation, each part in its diverse kind, was made new again, </div><div class='q2'>complying with your commandments, </div><div class='q2'>that your servants might be kept unharmed. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span> Then the cloud that overshadowed the camp was seen, </div><div class='q2'>and dry land rising up out of what had been water, </div><div class='q2'>out of the Red sea an unhindered highway, </div><div class='q2'>and a grassy plain out of the violent surge, </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> by which they passed over with all their army, </div><div class='q2'>these who were covered with your hand, </div><div class='q2'>having seen strange marvels. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For like horses they roamed at large, </div><div class='q2'>and they skipped about like lambs, </div><div class='q2'>praising you, O Lord, who was their deliverer. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For they still remembered the things that happened in the time of their sojourning, </div><div class='q2'>how instead of bearing cattle, the land brought forth lice, </div><div class='q2'>and instead of fish, the river spewed out a multitude of frogs. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But afterwards, they also saw a new generation race of birds, </div><div class='q2'>when, led on by desire, they asked for luxurious dainties; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For, to comfort them, quails came up for them from the sea. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Punishments came upon the sinners, </div><div class='q2'>not without the signs that were given beforehand by the force of the thunders; </div><div class='q2'>for they justly suffered through their own wickednesses, </div><div class='q2'>for the hatred which they practiced toward guests was grievous indeed. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> For whereas the others didn’t receive the strangers when they came to them, </div><div class='q2'>the Egyptians made slaves of guests who were their benefactors. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And not only so, but God will visit the men of Sodom another way, </div><div class='q2'>since they received as enemies those who were aliens; </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>whereas these first welcomed with feastings, </div><div class='q2'>and then afflicted with dreadful toils, </div><div class='q2'>those who had already shared with them in the same rights. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And moreover they were stricken with loss of sight </div><div class='q2'>(even as were those others at the righteous man’s doors), </div><div class='q2'>when, being surrounded with yawning darkness, </div><div class='q2'>they each looked for the passage through his own door. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For as the notes of a lute vary the character of the rhythm, </div><div class='q2'>even so the elements, changing their order one with another, </div><div class='q2'>continuing always in its sound, </div><div class='q2'>as may clearly be conjectured from the sight of the things that have happened. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For creatures of the dry land were turned into creatures of the waters, </div><div class='q2'>and creatures that swim moved upon the land. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Fire kept the mastery of its own power in water, </div><div class='q2'>and water forgot its quenching nature. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>On the contrary, flames didn’t consume flesh of perishable creatures that walked among them, </div><div class='q2'>neither did they melt the ice-like grains of ambrosial food that were apt to melt. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For in all things, O Lord, you magnified your people, </div><div class='q2'>and you glorified them and didn’t lightly regard them, </div><div class='q2'>standing by their side in every time and place. </div><ul class='tnav'>
