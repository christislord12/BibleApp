Therefore great wrath came from Yahweh of Armies.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>It has come to pass that, as he called, and they refused to listen, so they will call, and I will not listen,” said Yahweh of Armies;  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>“but I will scatter them with a whirlwind among all the nations which they have not known. Thus the land was desolate after them, so that no man passed through nor returned: for they made the pleasant land desolate.” </div><ul class='tnav'>
