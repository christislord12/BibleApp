<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 3</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Woe to her who is rebellious and polluted, the oppressing city!  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>She didn’t obey the voice. She didn’t receive correction. She didn’t trust in Yahweh. She didn’t draw near to her God.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Her princes within her are roaring lions. Her judges are evening wolves. They leave nothing until the next day.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Her prophets are arrogant and treacherous people. Her priests have profaned the sanctuary. They have done violence to the law.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Yahweh, within her, is righteous. He will do no wrong. Every morning he brings his justice to light. He doesn’t fail, but the unjust know no shame.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I have cut off nations. Their battlements are desolate. I have made their streets waste, so that no one passes by. Their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, so that there is no inhabitant.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I said, “Just fear me. Receive correction, so that her dwelling won’t be cut off, according to all that I have appointed concerning her.” But they rose early and corrupted all their doings.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>“Therefore wait for me”, says Yahweh, “until the day that I rise up to the prey, for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour on them my indignation, even all my fierce anger, for all the earth will be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For then I will purify the lips of the peoples, that they may all call on Yahweh’s name, to serve him shoulder to shoulder.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>From beyond the rivers of Cush, my worshipers, even the daughter of my dispersed people, will bring my offering.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>In that day you will not be disappointed for all your doings, in which you have transgressed against me; for then I will take away out from among you your proudly exulting ones, and you will no more be arrogant in my holy mountain.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But I will leave among you an afflicted and poor people, and they will take refuge in Yahweh’s name.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The remnant of Israel will not do iniquity, nor speak lies, neither will a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth, for they will feed and lie down, and no one will make them afraid.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Sing, daughter of Zion! Shout, Israel! Be glad and rejoice with all your heart, daughter of Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Yahweh has taken away your judgments. He has thrown out your enemy. The King of Israel, Yahweh, is among you. You will not be afraid of evil any more.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>In that day, it will be said to Jerusalem, “Don’t be afraid, Zion. Don’t let your hands be weak.”  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Yahweh, your God, is among you, a mighty one who will save. He will rejoice over you with joy. He will calm you in his love. He will rejoice over you with singing.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I will remove those who grieve about the appointed feasts from you. They are a burden and a reproach to you.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Behold,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> “Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</span></a> at that time I will deal with all those who afflict you, and I will save those who are lame, and gather those who were driven away. I will give them praise and honor, whose shame has been in all the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>At that time I will bring you in, and at that time I will gather you; for I will give you honor and praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I restore your fortunes before your eyes, says Yahweh. </div><ul class='tnav'>
