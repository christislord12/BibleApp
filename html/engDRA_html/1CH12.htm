For thy God helpeth thee. So David received them, and made them captains of the band.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And there were some of Manasses that went over to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to fight: but he did not fight with them: because the lords of the Philistines taking counsel sent him back, saying: With the danger of our heads he will return to his master Saul.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>So when he went back to Siceleg, there fled to him of Manasses, Ednas and Jozabad, and Jedihel, and Michael, and Ednas, and Jozabad, and Eliu, and Salathi, captains of thousands in Manasses.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>These helped David against the rovers: for they were all most valiant men, and were made commanders in the army.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Moreover day by day there came some to David to help him till they became a great number, like the army of God.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And this is the number of the chiefs of the army who came to David, when he was in Hebron, to transfer to him the kingdom of Saul, according to the word of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The sons of Juda bearing shield and spear, six thousand eight hundred well appointed to war.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Of the sons of Simeon valiant men for war, seven thousand one hundred.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Of the sons of Levi, four thousand six hundred.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Joiada prince of the race of Aaron, and with him three thousand seven hundred.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Sadoc also a young man of excellent disposition, and the house of his father, twenty-two principal men.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And of the sons of Benjamin the brethren of Saul, three thousand: for hitherto a great part of them followed the house of Saul.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And of the sons of Ephraim twenty thousand eight hundred, men of great valour renowned in their kindreds.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And of the half tribe of Manasses, eighteen thousand, every one by their names, came to make David king.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Also of the sons of Issachar men of understanding, that knew all times to order what Israel should do, two hundred principal men: and all the rest of the tribe followed their counsel.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And of Zabulon such as went forth to battle, and stood in array well appointed with armour for war, there came fifty thousand to his aid, with no double heart.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And of Nephtali, a thousand leaders: and with them seven and thirty thousand, furnished with shield and spear.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Of Dan also twenty-eight thousand six hundred prepared for battle.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And of Aser forty thousand going forth to fight, and challenging in battle.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And on the other side of the Jordan of the sons of Ruben, and of Gad, and of the half of the tribe of Manasses a hundred and twenty thousand, furnished with arms for war.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>All these men of war well appointed to fight, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel, were of one heart to make David king.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And they were there with David three days eating and drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Moreover they that were near them even as far as Issachar, and Zabulon, and Nephtali, brought leaves on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, to eat: meal, figs, raisins, wine, oil, and oxen, and sheep in abundance, for there was joy in Israel. </div><ul class='tnav'>
