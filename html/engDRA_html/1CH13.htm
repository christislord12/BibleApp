And Oza and his brother drove the cart.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And David and all Israel played before God with all their might with hymns, and with harps, and with psalteries, and timbrels, and cymbals, and trumpets,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And when they came to the floor of Chidon, Oza put forth his hand, to hold up the ark: for the ox being wanton had made it lean a little on one side.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the Lord was angry with Oza, and struck him, because he had touched the ark; and he died there before the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And David was troubled because the Lord had divided Oza: and he called that place the Breach of Oza to this day.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he feared God at that time, saying: How can I bring in the ark of God to me?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And therefore he brought it not home to himself, that is, into the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gethite.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the ark of God remained in the house of Obededom three months: and the Lord blessed his house, and all that he had. </div><ul class='tnav'>
