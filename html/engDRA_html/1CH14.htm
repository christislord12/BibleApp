And the Lord said to him: Go up, and I will deliver them into thy hand.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And when they were come to Baalpharasim, David defeated them there, and he said: God hath divided my enemies by my hand, as waters are divided: and therefore the name of that place was called Baalpharasim.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And they left there their gods, and David commanded that they should be burnt.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Another time also the Philistines made an irruption, and spread themselves abroad in the valley.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And David consulted God again, and God said to him: Go not up after them, turn away from them, and come upon them over against the pear trees.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And when thou shalt hear the sound of one going in the tops of the pear trees, then shalt thou go out to battle. For God is gone out before thee to strike the army of the Philistines.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And David did as God had commanded him, and defeated the army of the Philistines, slaying them from Gabaon to Gazera.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the name of David became famous in all countries, and the Lord made all nations fear him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
