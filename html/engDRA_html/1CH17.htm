<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 17</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Now when David was dwelling in his house, he said to Nathan the prophet: Behold I dwell in a house of cedar: and the ark of the covenant of the Lord is under skins.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And Nathan said to David: Do all that is in thy heart: for God is with thee.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Now that night the word of God came to Nathan, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Go, and speak to David my servant: Thus saith the Lord: Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For I have not remained in a house from the time that I brought up Israel, to this day: but I have been always changing places in a tabernacle, and in a tent,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Abiding with all Israel. Did I ever speak to any one, of all the judges of Israel, whom I charged to feed my people, saying: Why have you not built me a house of cedar?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Now therefore thus shalt thou say to my servant David: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: I took thee from the pastures, from following the flock, that thou shouldst be ruler of my people Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast gone: and have slain all thy enemies before thee, and have made thee a name like that of one of the great ones that are renowned in the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And I have given a place to my people Israel: they shall be planted, and shall dwell therein, and shall be moved no more, neither shall the children of iniquity waste them, as at the beginning,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Since the days that I gave judges to my people Israel, and have humbled all thy enemies. And I declare to thee, that the Lord will build thee a house.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And when thou shalt have ended thy days to go to thy fathers, I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons: and I will establish his kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But I will settle him in my house, and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be most firm for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And king David came and sat before the Lord, and said: Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my house, that thou shouldst give such things to me?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But even this hath seemed little in thy sight, and therefore thou hast also spoken concerning the house of thy servant for the time to come: and best made me remarkable above all men, O Lord God.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>What can David add more, seeing thou hast thus glorified thy servant, and known him?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>O Lord, for thy servant’s sake, according to thy own heart, thou hast shewn all this magnificence, and wouldst have all the great things to be known.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>O Lord there is none like thee: and there is no other God beside thee, of all whom we have heard of with our ears.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For what other nation is there upon earth like thy people Israel, whom God went to deliver, and make a people for himself, and by his greatness and terrors cast out nations before their face whom he had delivered out of Egypt?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And thou hast made thy people Israel to be thy own people for ever, and thou, O Lord, art become their God.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Now therefore, O Lord, let the word which thou hast spoken to thy servant, and concerning his house, be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And let thy name remain and be magnified for ever: and let it be said: The Lord of hosts is God of Israel, and the house of David his servant remaineth before him.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For thou, O Lord my God, hast revealed to the ear of thy servant, that thou wilt build him a house: and therefore thy servant hath found confidence to pray before thee.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And now O Lord, thou art God: and thou hast promised to thy servant such great benefits.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And thou hast begun to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be always before thee: for seeing thou blessest it, O Lord, it shall be blessed for ever. </div><ul class='tnav'>
