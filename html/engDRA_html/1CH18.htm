And the Lord assisted him in all things to which he went.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And David took the golden quivers which the servants of Adarezer had, and he brought them to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Likewise out of Thebath and Chun, cities of Adarezer, he brought very much brass, of which Solomon made the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Now when Thou king of Hemath heard that David had defeated all the army of Adarezer king of Soba,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He sent Adoram his son to king David, to desire peace of him, and to congratulate him that he had defeated and overthrown Adarezer: for Thou was an enemy to Adarezer.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And all the vessels of gold, and silver, and brass king David consecrated to the Lord, with the silver and gold which he had taken from all the nations, as well from Edom, and from Moab, and from the sons of Ammon, as from the Philistines, and from Amalec.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Abisai the son of Sarvia slew of the Edomites in the vale of the saltpits, eighteen thousand:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And he put a garrison in Edom, that Edom should serve David: and the Lord preserved David in all things to which he went.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Joab the son of Sarvia was over the army, and Josaphat the son of Ahilud recorder.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Sadoc the son of Achitob, and Achimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests: and Susa, scribe.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Banaias the son of Joiada was over the bands of the Cerethi, and the Phelethi: and the sons of David were chief about the king. </div><ul class='tnav'>
