But David stayed at Jerusalem, when Joab smote Rabba, and destroyed it.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And David took the crown of Melchom from his head, and found in it a talent weight of gold, and most precious stones, and he made himself a diadem of it: he took also the spoils of the city which were very great.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And the people that were therein he brought out: and made harrows, and sleds, and chariots of iron to go over them, so that they were cut and bruised to pieces: in this manner David dealt with all the cities of the children of Ammon: and he returned with alibis people to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>After this there arose a war at Gazer against the Philistines: in which Sabachai the Husathite slew Saphai of the race of Raphaim, and humbled them.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Another battle also was fought against the Philistines, in which Adeodatus the son of Saltus a Bethlehemite slew the brother of Goliath the Gethite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>There was another battle also in Geth, in which there was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each hand and foot: who also was born of the stock of Rapha.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>He reviled Israel: but Jonathan the son of Samaa the brother of David slew him. These were the sons of Rapha in Geth, who fell by the hand of David and his servants. </div><ul class='tnav'>
