And there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he sent an angel to Jerusalem, to strike it: and as he was striking it, the Lord beheld, and took pity for the greatness of the evil: and said to the angel that destroyed: It is enough, now stop thy hand. And the angel of the Lord stood by the thrashing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And David lifting up his eyes, saw the angel of the Lord standing between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand, turned against Jerusalem: and both he and the ancients clothed in haircloth, fell down flat on the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And David said to God: Am not I he that commanded the people to be numbered? It is I that have sinned: it is I that have done the evil: but as for this flock, what hath it deserved? O Lord my God, let thy hand be turned, I beseech thee, upon me, and upon my father’s house: and let not thy people be destroyed.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the angel of the Lord commanded Gad to tell David, to go up, and build an altar to the Lord God in the thrashingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And David went up, according to the word of Gad, which he spoke to him in the name of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Now when Ornan looked up, and saw the angel, he and his four sons hid themselves: for at that time he was thrashing wheat in the floor.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And as David was coming to Ornan, Ornan saw him, and went out of the thrashingfloor to meet him, and bowed down to him with his face to the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And David said to him: Give me this place of thy thrashingfloor, that I may build therein an altar to the Lord: but thou shalt take of me as much money as it is worth, that the plague may cease from the people.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Ornan said to David: Take it, and let my lord the king do all that pleaseth him: and moreover the oxen also I give for a holocaust, and the drays for wood, and the wheat for the sacrifice: I will give it all willingly.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And king David said to him: It shall not be so, but I will give thee money as much as it is worth: for I must not take it from thee, and so offer to the Lord holocausts free cost.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>So David gave to Ornan for the place, six hundred sicles of gold of just weight.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And he built there an altar to the Lord: and he offered holocausts, and peace offerings, and he called upon the Lord, and he heard him by sending Are from heaven upon the altar of the holocaust.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the Lord commanded the angel: and he put up his sword again into the sheath.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And David seeing that the Lord had heard him in the thrashingfloor of Oman the Jebusite, forthwith offered victims there.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>But the tabernacle of the Lord, which Moses made in the desert, and the altar of holocausts, was at that time in the high place of Gabaon.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And David could not go to the altar there to pray to God: for he was seized with an exceeding great fear, seeing the sword of the angel of the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
