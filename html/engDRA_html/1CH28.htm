If thou seek him, thou shalt find him: but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Now therefore seeing the Lord hath chosen thee to build the house of the sanctuary, take courage, and do it.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And David gave to Solomon his son a description of the porch, and of the temple, and of the treasures, and of the upper floor, and of the inner chambers, and of the house for the mercy seat,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>As also of all the courts, which he had in his thought, and of the chambers round about, for the treasures of the house of the Lord, and for the treasures of the consecrated things,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And of the divisions of the priests and of the Levites, for all the works of the house of the Lord, and for all the vessels of the service of the temple of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Gold by weight for every vessel for the ministry. And silver by weight according to the diversity of the vessels and uses.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He gave also gold for the golden candlesticks, and their lamps, according to the dimensions of every candlestick, and the lamps thereof. In like manner also he gave silver by weight for the silver candlesticks, and for their lamps according to the diversity of the dimensions of them.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He gave also gold for the tables of proposition, according to the diversity of the tables: in like manner also silver for other tables of silver.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For fleshhooks also, and bowls, and censers of fine gold, and for little lions of gold, according to the measure he gave by weight, for every lion. In like manner also for lions of silver he set aside a different weight of silver.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And for the altar of incense, he gave the purest gold: and to make the likeness of the chariot of the cherubims spreading their wings, and covering the ark of the covenant of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>All these things, said he, came to me written by the hand of the Lord that I might understand all the works of the pattern.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And David said to Solomon his son: Act like a man, and take courage, and do: fear not, and be not dismayed: for the Lord my God will be with thee, and will not leave thee, nor forsake thee, till thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Behold the courses of the priests and the Levites, for every ministry of the house of the Lord, stand by thee, and are ready, and both the princes, and the people know how to execute all thy commandments. </div><ul class='tnav'>
