For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For what man knoweth the things of a man, but the spirit of a man that is in him? So the things also that are of God no man knoweth, but the Spirit of God.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Now we have received not the spirit of this world, but the Spirit that is of God; that we may know the things that are given us from God.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Which things also we speak, not in the learned words of human wisdom; but in the doctrine of the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But the sensual man perceiveth not these things that are of the Spirit of God; for it is foolishness to him, and he cannot understand, because it is spiritually examined.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But the spiritual man judgeth all things; and he himself is judged of no man.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that we may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ. </div><ul class='tnav'>
