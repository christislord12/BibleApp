<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 3</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And I, brethren, could not speak to you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal. As unto little ones in Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I gave you milk to drink, not meat; for you were not able as yet. But neither indeed are you now able; for you are yet carnal.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For, whereas there is among you envying and contention, are you not carnal, and walk according to man?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For while one saith, I indeed am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollo; are you not men? What then is Apollo, and what is Paul?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The ministers of him whom you have believed; and to every one as the Lord hath given.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I have planted, Apollo watered, but God gave the increase.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Therefore, neither he that planteth is any thing, nor he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Now he that planteth, and he that watereth, ate one. And every man shall receive his own reward, according to his own labour.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For we are God’s coadjutors: you are God’s husbandry; you are God’s building.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>According to the grace of God that is given to me, as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation; and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For other foundation no man can lay, but that which is laid; which is Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Now if any man build upon this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Every man’s work shall be manifest; for the day of the Lord shall declare it, because it shall be revealed in fire; and the fire shall try every man’s work, of what sort it is.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>If any man’s work abide, which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>If any man’s work burn, he shall suffer loss; but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Know you not, that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But if any man violate the temple of God, him shall God destroy. For the temple of God is holy, which you are.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Let no man deceive himself: if any man among you seem to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written: I will catch the wise in their own craftiness.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And again: The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Let no man therefore glory in men.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For all things are yours, whether it be Paul, or Apollo, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to some; for all are yours;  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And you are Christ’s; and Christ is God’s. </div><ul class='tnav'>
