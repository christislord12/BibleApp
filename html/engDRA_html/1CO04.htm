Or what hast thou that thou hast not received? And if thou hast received, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>You are now full; you are now become rich; you reign without us; and I would to God you did reign, that we also might reign with you.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For I think that God hath set forth us apostles, the last, as it were men appointed to death: we are made a spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>We are fools for Christ’s sake, but you are wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are honourable, but we without honour.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Even unto this hour we both hunger and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no fixed abode;  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And we labour, working with our own hands: we are reviled, and we bless; we are persecuted, and we suffer it.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>We are blasphemed, and we entreat; we are made as the refuse of this world, the offscouring of all even until now.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I write not these things to confound you; but I admonish you as my dearest children.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For if you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet not many fathers. For in Christ Jesus, by the gospel, I have begotten you.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For this cause have I sent to you Timothy, who is my dearest son and faithful in the Lord; who will put you in mind of my ways, which are in Christ Jesus; as I teach every where in every church.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>As if I would not come to you, so some are puffed up.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will: and will know, not the speech of them that are puffed up, but the power.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For the kingdom of God is not in speech, but in power.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>What will you? shall I come to you with a rod; or in charity, and in the spirit of meekness? </div><ul class='tnav'>
