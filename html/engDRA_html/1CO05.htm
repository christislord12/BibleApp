Know you not that a little leaven corrupteth the whole lump?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new paste, as you are unleavened. For Christ our pasch is sacrificed.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Therefore let us feast, not with the old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I wrote to you in an epistle, not to keep company with fornicators.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I mean not with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or the extortioners, or the servers of idols; otherwise you must needs go out of this world.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But now I have written to you, not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother, be a fornicator, or covetous, or a server of idols, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner: with such a one, not so much as to eat.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For what have I to do to judge them that are without? Do not you judge them that are within?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For them that are without, God will judge. Put away the evil one from among yourselves. </div><ul class='tnav'>
