<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 6</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to be judged before the unjust, and not before the saints?  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Know you not that the saints shall judge this world? And if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Know you not that we shall judge angels? how much more things of this world?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>If therefore you have judgments of things pertaining to this world, set them to judge, who are the most despised in the church.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>I speak to your shame. Is it so that there is not among you any one wise man, that is able to judge between his brethren?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before unbelievers.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Already indeed there is plainly a fault among you, that you have lawsuits one with another. Why do you not rather take wrong? Why do you not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But you do wrong and defraud, and that to your brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Know you not that the unjust shall not possess the kingdom of God? Do not err: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Nor the effeminate, nor liers with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor railers, nor extortioners, shall possess the kingdom of God.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And such some of you were; but you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Spirit of our God.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>All things are lawful to me, but all things are not expedient. All things are lawful to me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Meat for the belly, and the belly for the meats; but God shall destroy both it and them: but the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Now God hath both raised up the Lord, and will raise us up also by his power.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Or know you not, that he who is joined to a harlot, is made one body? For they shall be, saith he, two in one flesh.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But he who is joined to the Lord, is one spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Fly fornication. Every sin that a man doth, is without the body; but he that committeth fornication, sinneth against his own body.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Or know you not, that your members are the temple of the Holy Ghost, who is in you, whom you have from God; and you are not your own?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For you are bought with a great price. Glorify and bear God in your body. </div><ul class='tnav'>
