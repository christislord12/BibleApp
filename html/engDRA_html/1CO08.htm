<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 8</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Now concerning those things that are sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up; but charity edifieth.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he hath not yet known as he ought to know.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>But if any any love God, the same is known by him.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But as for the meats that are sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but one.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For although there be that are called gods, either in heaven or on earth (for there be gods many, and lords many).  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Yet to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But there is not knowledge in every one. For some until this present, with conscience of the idol: eat as a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But meat doth not commend us to God. For neither, if we eat, shall we have the more; nor, if we eat not, shall we have the less.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But take heed lest perhaps this your liberty become a stumblingblock to the weak.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For if a man see him that hath knowledge sit at meat in the idol’s temple, shall not his conscience, being weak, be emboldened to eat those things which are sacrificed to idols?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ hath died?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Now when you sin thus against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Wherefore, if meat scandalize my brother, I will never eat flesh, lest I should scandalize my brother. </div><ul class='tnav'>
