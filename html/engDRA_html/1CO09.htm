<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 9</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Am not I free? Am not I an apostle? Have not I seen Christ Jesus our Lord? Are not you my work in the Lord?  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And if unto others I be not an apostle, but yet to you I am. For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>My defence with them that do examine me is this.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Have not we power to eat and to drink?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Have we not power to carry about a woman, a sister, as well as the rest of the apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to do this?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Who serveth as a soldier at any time, at his own charges? Who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? Who feedeth the flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Speak I these things according to man? Or doth not the law also say these things?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For it is written in the law of Moses: Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Or doth he say this indeed for our sakes? For these things are written for our sakes: that he that plougheth, should plough in hope; and he that thrasheth, in hope to receive fruit.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we reap your carnal things?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>If others be partakers of this power over you, why not we rather? Nevertheless, we have not used this power: but we bear all things, lest we should give any hindrance to the gospel of Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Know you not, that they who work in the holy place, eat the things that are of the holy place; and they that serve the altar, partake with the altar?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So also the Lord ordained that they who preach the gospel, should live by the gospel.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But I have used none of these things. Neither have I written these things, that they should be so done unto me: for it is good for me to die, rather than that any man should make my glory void.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For if I preach the gospel, it is no glory to me, for a necessity lieth upon me: for woe is unto me if I preach not the gospel.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation is committed to me:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>What is my reward then? That preaching the gospel, I may deliver the gospel without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For whereas I was free as to all, I made myself the servant of all, that I might gain the more.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And I became to the Jews, a Jew, that I might gain the Jews:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>To them that are under the law, as if I were under the law, (whereas myself was not under the law,) that I might gain them that were under the law. To them that were without the law, as if I were without the law, (whereas I was not without the law of God, but was in the law of Christ,) that I might gain them that were without the law.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak. I became all things to all men, that I might save all.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And I do all things for the gospel’s sake: that I may be made partaker thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Know you not that they that run in the race, all run indeed, but one receiveth the prize? So run that you may obtain.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And every one that striveth for the mastery, refraineth himself from all things: and they indeed that they may receive a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible one.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>I therefore so run, not as at an uncertainty: I so fight, not as one beating the air:  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But I chastise my body, and bring it into subjection: lest perhaps, when I have preached to others, I myself should become a castaway. </div><ul class='tnav'>
