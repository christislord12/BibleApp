<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 11</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Be ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Now I praise you, brethren, that in all things you are mindful of me: and keep my ordinances as I have delivered them to you.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered, disgraceth his head.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But every woman praying or prophesying with her head not covered, disgraceth her head: for it is all one as if she were shaven.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For if a woman be not covered, let her be shorn. But if it be a shame to a woman to be shorn or made bald, let her cover her head.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The man indeed ought not to cover his head, because he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of the man.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For the man was not created for the woman, but the woman for the man.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Therefore ought the woman to have a power over her head, because of the angels.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But yet neither is the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For as the woman is of the man, so also is the man by the woman: but all things of God.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>You yourselves judge: doth it become a woman, to pray unto God uncovered?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Doth not even nature itself teach you, that a man indeed, if he nourish his hair, it is a shame unto him?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But if a woman nourish her hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given to her for a covering.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor the church of God.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Now this I ordain: not praising you, that you come together not for the better, but for the worse.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For first of all I hear that when you come together in the church, there are schisms among you; and in part I believe it.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For there must be also heresies: that they also, who are approved, may be made manifest among you.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>When you come therefore together into one place, it is not now to eat the Lord’s supper.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For every one taketh before his own supper to eat. And one indeed is hungry and another is drunk.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>What, have you not houses to eat and to drink in? Or despise ye the church of God; and put them to shame that have not? What shall I say to you? Do I praise you? In this I praise you not.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And giving thanks, broke, and said: Take ye, and eat: this is my body, which shall be delivered for you: this do for the commemoration of me.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>In like manner also the chalice, after he had supped, saying: This chalice is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as often as you shall drink, for the commemoration of me.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For as often as you shall eat this bread, and drink the chalice, you shall shew the death of the Lord, until he come.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Therefore whosoever shall eat this bread, or drink the chalice of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But let a man prove himself: and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of the chalice.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself, not discerning the body of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Therefore are there many infirm and weak among you, and many sleep.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>But if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But whilst we are judged, we are chastised by the Lord, that we be not condemned with this world.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>If any man be hungry, let him eat at home; that you come not together unto judgment. And the rest I will set in order, when I come. </div><ul class='tnav'>
