<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 12</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Now concerning spiritual things, my brethren, I would not have you ignorant.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>You know that when you were heathens, you went to dumb idols, according as you were led.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man, speaking by the Spirit of God, saith Anathema to Jesus. And no man can say the Lord Jesus, but by the Holy Ghost.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Now there are diversities of graces, but the same Spirit;  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And there are diversities of ministries, but the same Lord;  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And there are diversities of operations, but the same God, who worketh all in all.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man unto profit.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>To one indeed, by the Spirit, is given the word of wisdom: and to another, the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit;  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>To another, faith in the same spirit; to another, the grace of healing in one Spirit;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>To another, the working of miracles; to another, prophecy; to another, the discerning of spirits; to another, diverse kinds of tongues; to another, interpretation of speeches.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But all these things one and the same Spirit worketh, dividing to every one according as he will.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For as the body is one, and hath many members; and all the members of the body, whereas they are many, yet are one body, so also is Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Gentiles, whether bond or free; and in one Spirit we have all been made to drink.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For the body also is not one member, but many.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>If the foot should say, because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And if the ear should say, because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>If the whole body were the eye, where would be the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where would be the smelling?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But now God hath set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And if they all were one member, where would be the body?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But now there are many members indeed, yet one body.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the eye cannot say to the hand: I need not thy help; nor again the head to the feet: I have no need of you.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Yea, much more those that seem to be the more feeble members of the body, are more necessary.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And such as we think to be the less honourable members of the body, about these we put more abundant honour; and those that are our uncomely parts, have more abundant comeliness.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, giving to that which wanted the more abundant honour,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>That there might be no schism in the body; but the members might be mutually careful one for another.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And if one member suffer any thing, all the members suffer with it; or if one member glory, all the members rejoice with it.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Now you are the body of Christ, and members of member.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And God indeed hath set some in the church; first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly doctors; after that miracles; then the graces of healing, helps, governments, kinds of tongues, interpretations of speeches.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all doctors?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Are all workers of miracles? Have all the grace of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>But be zealous for the better gifts. And I shew unto you yet a more excellent way. </div><ul class='tnav'>
