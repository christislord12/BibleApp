But, when I became a man, I put away the things of a child.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>We see now through a glass in a dark manner; but then face to face. Now I know I part; but then I shall know even as I am known.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And now there remain faith, hope, and charity, these three: but the greatest of these is charity. </div><ul class='tnav'>
