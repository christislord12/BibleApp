<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 14</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Follow after charity, be zealous for spiritual gifts; but rather that you may prophesy.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>For he that speaketh in a tongue, speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man heareth. Yet by the Spirit he speaketh mysteries.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>But he that prophesieth, speaketh to men unto edification, and exhortation, and comfort.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>He that speaketh in a tongue, edifieth himself: but he that prophesieth, edifieth the church.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And I would have you all to speak with tongues, but rather to prophesy. For greater is he that prophesieth, than he that speaketh with tongues: unless perhaps he interpret, that the church may receive edification.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either in revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophecy, or in doctrine?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Even things without life that give sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction of sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So likewise you, except you utter by the tongue plain speech, how shall it be known what is said? For you shall be speaking into the air.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>There are, for example, so many kinds of tongues in this world; and none is without voice.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>If then I know not the power of the voice, I shall be to him to whom I speak a barbarian; and he that speaketh, a barbarian to me.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>So you also, forasmuch as you are zealous of spirits, seek to abound unto the edifying of the church.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And therefore he that speaketh by a tongue, let him pray that he may interpret.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is without fruit.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, I will pray also with the understanding; I will sing with the spirit, I will sing also with the understanding.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Else if thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that holdeth the place of the unlearned say, Amen, to thy blessing? because he knoweth not what thou sayest.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For thou indeed givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I thank my God I speak with all your tongues.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I may instruct others also; than ten thousand words in a tongue.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Brethren, do not become children in sense: but in malice be children, and in sense be perfect.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>In the law it is written: In other tongues and other lips I will speak to this people; and neither so will they hear me, saith the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to believers, but to unbelievers; but prophecies not to unbelievers, but to believers.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>If therefore the whole church come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in unlearned persons or infidels, will they not say that you are mad?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or an unlearned person, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so, falling down on his face, he will adore God, affirming that God is among you indeed.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>How is it then, brethren? When you come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a revelation, hath a tongue, hath an interpretation: let all things be done to edification.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>If any speak with a tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and in course, and let one interpret.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But if there be no interpreter, let him hold his peace in the church, and speak to himself and to God.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And let the prophets speak, two or three; and let the rest judge.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But if any thing be revealed to another sitting, let the first hold his peace.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For you may all prophesy one by one; that all may learn, and all may be exhorted:  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>For God is not the God of dissension, but of peace: as also I teach in all the churches of the saints.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Let women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted them to speak, but to be subject, as also the law saith.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>But if they would learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Or did the word of God come out from you? Or came it only unto you?  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>If any seem to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him know the things that I write to you, that they are the commandments of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>But if any man know not, he shall not be known.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Wherefore, brethren, be zealous to prophesy; and forbid not to speak with tongues.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>But let all things be done decently, and according to order. </div><ul class='tnav'>
