And every one that loveth him who begot, loveth him also who is born of him.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>In this we know that we love the children of God: when we love God, and keep his commandments.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For this is the charity of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not heavy.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For whatsoever is born of God, overcometh the world: and this is the victory which overcometh the world, our faith.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>This is he that came by water and blood, Jesus Christ: not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit which testifieth, that Christ is the truth.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And there are three who give testimony in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost. And these three are one.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And there are three that give testimony on earth: the spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three are one.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater. For this is the testimony of God, which is greater, because he hath testified of his Son.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He that believeth in the Son of God, hath the testimony of God in himself. He that believeth not the Son, maketh him a liar: because he believeth not in the testimony which God hath testified of his Son.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And this is the testimony, that God hath given to us eternal life. And this life is in his Son.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>He that hath the Son, hath life. He that hath not the Son, hath not life.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>These things I write to you, that you may know that you have eternal life, you who believe in the name of the Son of God.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And this is the confidence which we have towards him: That, whatsoever we shall ask according to his will, he heareth us.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And we know that he heareth us whatsoever we ask: we know that we have the petitions which we request of him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He that knoweth his brother to sin a sin which is not to death, let him ask, and life shall be given to him, who sinneth not to death. There is a sin unto death: for that I say not that any man ask.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>All iniquity is sin. And there is a sin unto death.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>We know that whosoever is born of God, sinneth not: but the generation of God preserveth him, and the wicked one toucheth him not.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>We know that we are of God, and the whole world is seated in wickedness.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And we know that the Son of God is come: and he hath given us understanding that we may know the true God, and may be in his true Son. This is the true God and life eternal.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen. </div><ul class='tnav'>
