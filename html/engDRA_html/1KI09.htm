And he called them the land of Chabul, unto this day.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Hiram sent to king Solomon a hundred and twenty talents of gold.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>This is the sum of the expenses, which king Solomon offered to build the house of the Lord, and his own house, and Mello, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Heser, and Mageddo, and Gazer.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Pharao the king of Egypt came up and took Gazer, and burnt it with fire: and slew the Chanaanite that dwelt in the city, and gave it for a dowry to his daughter, Solomon’s wife.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So Solomon built: Gazer, and Beth-horon the nether,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Baalath, and Palmira in the land of the wilderness.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And all the towns that belonged to himself, and were not walled, he fortified, the cities also of the chariots, and the cities of the horsemen, and whatsoever he had a mind to build in Jerusalem, and in Libanus, and in all the land of his dominion.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>All the people that were left of the Amorrhites, and Hethites, and Pherezites, and Hevites, and Jebusites, that are not of the children of Israel:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Their children, that were left in the land, to wit, such as the children of Israel had not been able to destroy, Solomon made tributary unto this day.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But of the children of Israel Solomon made not any to be bondmen, but they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and captains, and overseers of the chariots and horses.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And there were five hundred and fifty chief officers set over all the works of Solomon, and they had people under them, and had charge over the appointed works.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the daughter of Pharao came up out of the city of David to her house, which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Mello.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Solomon also offered three times every year holocausts, and victims of peace offerings upon the altar which he had built to the Lord, and he burnt incense before the Lord: and the temple was finished.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And king Solomon made a fleet in Asiongaber, which is by Ailath on the shore of the Red Sea in the land of Edom.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Hiram sent his servants in the fleet, sailors that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And they came to Ophir, and they brought from thence to king Solomon four hundred and twenty talents of gold. </div><ul class='tnav'>
