<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 13</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Now Simon heard that Tryphon was gathering together a very great army, to invade the land of Juda, and to destroy it.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And seeing that the people was in dread, and in fear, he went up to Jerusalem, and assembled the people:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And exhorted them, saying: You know what great battles I and my brethren, and the house of my father, have fought for the laws, and the sanctuary, and the distresses that we have seen:  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>By reason whereof all my brethren have lost their lives for Israel’s sake, and I am left alone.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And now far be it from me to spare my life in any time of trouble: for I am not better than my brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I will avenge then my nation and the sanctuary, and our children, and wives: for all the heathens are gathered together to destroy us out of mere malice.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the spirit of the people was enkindled as soon as they heard these words.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And they answered with a loud voice, saying: Thou art our leader in the place of Judas, and Jonathan thy brother.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Fight thou our battles, and we will do whatsoever thou shalt say to us.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So gathering together all the men of war, he made haste to finish all the walls of Jerusalem, and he fortified it round about.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And he sent Jonathan the son of Absalom, and with him a new army into Joppe, and he cast out them that were in it, and himself remained there.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Tryphon removed from Ptolemais with a great army, to invade the land of Juda, and Jonathan was with him in custody.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But Simon pitched in Addus, over against the plain.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And when Tryphon understood that Simon was risen up in the place of his brother Jonathan, and that he meant to join battle with him, he sent messengers to him,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Saying: We have detained thy brother Jonathan for the money that he owed in the king’s account, by reason of the affairs which he had the management of.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But now send a hundred talents of silver, and his two sons for hostages, that when he is set at liberty he may not revolt from us, and we will release him.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Now Simon knew that he spoke deceitfully to him, nevertheless he ordered the money, and the children to be sent: lest he should bring upon himself a great hatred of the people of Israel, who might have said:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Because he sent not the money, and the children, therefore is he lost.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>So he sent the children, and the hundred talents: and he lied, and did not let Jonathan go.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And after this Tryphon entered within the country, to destroy it: and they went about by the way that leadeth to Ador: and Simon and his army marched to every place whithersoever they went.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And they that were in the castle, sent messengers to Tryphon, that he should make haste to come through the desert, and sent them victuals.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Tryphon made ready all his horsemen to come that night: but there fell a very great snow, and he came not into the country of Galaad.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And when he approached to Bascama, he slew Jonathan and his sons there.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Tryphon returned, and went into his own country.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Simon sent, and took the bones of Jonathan his brother, and buried them in Modin, in the city of his fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And all Israel bewailed him with great lamentation: and they mourned for him many days.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Simon built over the sepulchre of his father and of his brethren, a building lofty to the sight, of polished stone behind and before:  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And he set up seven pyramids one against another for his father and his mother, and his four brethren:  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And round about these he set great pillars: and upon the pillars arms for a perpetual memory: and by the arms ships carved, which might be seen by all that sailed on the sea.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>This is the sepulchre that he made in Modin even unto this day.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>But Tryphon when he was upon a journey with the young king Antiochus, treacherously slew him.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And he reigned in his place, and put on the crown of Asia: and brought great evils upon the land.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And Simon built up the strong holds of Judea, fortifying them with high towers, and great walls, and gates, and bars: and he stored up victuals in the fortresses.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And Simon chose men and sent to king Demetrius, to the end that he should grant an immunity to the land: for all that Tryphon did was to spoil.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And king Demetrius in answer to this request, wrote a letter in this manner:  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>King Demetrius to Simon the high priest, and friend of kings, and to the ancients, and to the nation of the Jews, greeting.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>The golden crown, and the palm, which you sent, we have received: and we are ready to make a firm peace with you, and to write to the king’s chief officers to release you the things that we have released.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>For all that we have decreed in your favour, shall stand in force. The strong holds that you have built, shall be your own.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And as for any oversight or fault committed unto this day, we forgive it, and the crown which you owed: and if any other thing were taxed in Jerusalem, now let it not be taxed.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And if any of you be fit to be enrolled among ours, let them be enrolled, and let there be peace between us.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>In the year one hundred and seventy the yoke of the Gentiles was taken off from Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And the people of Israel began to write in the instruments, and public records, The first year under Simon the high priest, the great captain and prince of the Jews.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>In those days Simon besieged Gaza, and camped round about it, and he made engines, and set them to the city, and he struck one tower, and took it.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And they that were within the engine leaped into the city: and there was a great uproar in the city.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And they that were in the city went up with their wives and children upon the wall, with their garments rent, and they cried with a loud voice, beseeching Simon to grant them peace.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And they said: Deal not with us according to our evil deeds, but according to thy mercy.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And Simon being moved, did not destroy them: but yet he cast them out of the city, and cleansed the houses wherein there had been idols, and then he entered into it with hymns, blessing the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>And having cast out of it all uncleanness, he placed in it men that should observe the law: and he fortified it, and made it his habitation.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>But they that were in the castle of Jerusalem were hindered from going out and coming into the country, and from buying and selling: and they were straitened with hunger, and many of them perished through famine.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>And they cried to Simon form peace, and he granted it to them: and he cast them out from thence, and cleansed the castle from uncleannesses.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>And they entered into it the three and twentieth day of the second month, in the year one hundred and seventy-one, with thanksgiving, and branches of palm trees, and harps, and cymbals, and psalteries, and hymns, and canticles, because the great enemy was destroyed out of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>And he ordained that these days should be kept every year with gladness.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>And he fortified the mountain of the temple that was near the castle, and he dwelt there himself, and they that were with him.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>And Simon saw that John his son was a valiant man for war: and he made him captain of all the forces: and he dwelt in Gazara. </div><ul class='tnav'>
