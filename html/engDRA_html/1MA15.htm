and to Lampsacus, and to the Spartans, and to Delus, and Myndus, and Sicyon, and Caria, and Samus, and Pamphylia, and Lycia, and Alicarnassus, and Cos, and Side, and Aradus, and Rhodes, and Phaselis, and Gortyna, and Gnidus, and Cyprus, and Cyrene.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And they wrote a copy thereof to Simon the high priest, and to the people of the Jews.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But king Antiochus moved his camp to Dora the second time, assaulting it continually, and making engines: and shut up Tryphon, that he could not go out.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Simon sent to him two thousand chosen men to aid him, silver also, and gold, and abundance of furniture.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And he would not receive them, but broke all the covenant that he had made with him before, and alienated himself from him.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And he sent to him Athenobius one of his friends, to treat with him, saying: You hold Joppe, and Gazara, and the castle that is in Jerusalem, which are cities of my kingdom:  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Their borders you have wasted, and you have made great havock in the land, and have got the dominion of many places in my kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Now therefore deliver up the cities that you have taken, and the tributes of the places whereof you have gotten the dominion without the borders of Judea.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>But if not, give me for them five hundred talents of silver, and for the havock that you have made, and the tributes of the cities other five hundred talents: or else we will come and fight against you.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>So Athenobius the king’s friend came to Jerusalem, and saw the glory of Simon and his magnificence in gold, and silver, and his great equipage, and he was astonished, and told him the king’s words.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And Simon answered him, and said to him: We have neither taken other men’s land, neither do we hold that which is other men’s: but the inheritance of our fathers, which was for some time unjustly possessed by our enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But we having opportunity claim the inheritance of our fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And as to thy complaints concerning Joppe and Gazara, they did great harm to the people, and to our country: yet for these we will give a hundred talents. And Athenobius answered him not a word:  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>But returning in a rage to the king, made report to him of these words, and of the glory of Simon, and of all that he had seen, and the king was exceeding angry.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And Tryphon fled away by ship to Orthosias.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And the king appointed Cendebeus captain of the sea coast, and gave him an army of footmen and horsemen.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And he commanded him to march with his army towards Judea: and he commanded him to build up Gedor, and to fortify the gates of the city, and to war against the people. But the king himself pursued after Tryphon.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And Cendebeus came to Jamnia, and began to provoke the people, and to ravage Judea, and to take the people prisoners, and to kill, and to build Gedor.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And he placed there horsemen, and an army: that they might issue forth, and make incursions upon the ways of Judea, as the king had commanded him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
