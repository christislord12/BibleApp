<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 2</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Wherefore laying away all malice, and all guile, and dissimulations, and envies, and all detractions,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>As newborn babes, desire the rational milk without guile, that thereby you may grow unto salvation:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>If so be you have tasted that the Lord is sweet.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Unto whom coming, as to a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen and made honourable by God:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Be you also as living stones built up, a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Wherefore it is said in the scripture: Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious. And he that shall believe in him, shall not be confounded.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>To you therefore that believe, he is honour: but to them that believe not, the stone which the builders rejected, the same is made the head of the corner:  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of scandal, to them who stumble at the word, neither do believe, whereunto also they are set.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But you are a chosen generation, a kingly priesthood, a holy nation, a purchased people: that you may declare his virtues, who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Who in time past were not a people: but are now the people of God. Who had not obtained mercy; but now have obtained mercy.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, to refrain yourselves from carnal desires which war against the soul,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Having your conversation good among the Gentiles: that whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may, by the good works, which they shall behold in you, glorify God in the day of visitation.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Be ye subject therefore to every human creature for God’s sake: whether it be to the king as excelling;  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of the good:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For so is the will of God, that by doing well you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>As free, and not as making liberty a cloak for malice, but as the servants of God.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For this is thankworthy, if for conscience towards God, a man endure sorrows, suffering wrongfully.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For what glory is it, if committing sin, and being buffeted for it, you endure? But if doing well you suffer patiently; this is thankworthy before God.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For unto this are you called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving you an example that you should follow his steps.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Who, when he was reviled, did not revile: when he suffered, he threatened not: but delivered himself to him that judged him unjustly.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Who his own self bore our sins in his body upon the tree: that we, being dead to sins, should live to justice: by whose stripes you were healed.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For you were as sheep going astray; but you are now converted to the shepherd and bishop of your souls. </div><ul class='tnav'>
