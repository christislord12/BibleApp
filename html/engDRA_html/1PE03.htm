And be not afraid of their fear, and be not troubled.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But sanctify the Lord Christ in your hearts, being ready always to satisfy every one that asketh you a reason of that hope which is in you.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But with modesty and fear, having a good conscience: that whereas they speak evil of you, they may be ashamed who falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For it is better doing well (if such be the will of God) to suffer, than doing ill.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Because Christ also died once for our sins, the just for the unjust: that he might offer us to God, being put to death indeed in the flesh, but enlivened in the spirit,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>In which also coming he preached to those spirits that were in prison:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Which had been some time incredulous, when they waited for the patience of God in the days of Noe, when the ark was a building: wherein a few, that is, eight souls, were saved by water.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Whereunto baptism being of the like form, now saveth you also: not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the examination of a good conscience towards God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Who is on the right hand of God, swallowing down death, that we might be made heirs of life everlasting: being gone into heaven, the angels and powers and virtues being made subject to him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
