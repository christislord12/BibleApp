And do you all insinuate humility one to another, for God resisteth the proud, but to the humble he giveth grace.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Be you humbled therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in the time of visitation:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Casting all your care upon him, for he hath care of you.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Be sober and watch: because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, goeth about seeking whom he may devour.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Whom resist ye, strong in faith: knowing that the same affliction befalls your brethren who are in the world.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But the God of all grace, who hath called us into his eternal glory in Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a little, will himself perfect you, and confirm you, and establish you.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>To him be glory and empire for ever and ever. Amen.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>By Sylvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I think, I have written briefly: beseeching and testifying that this is the true grace of God, wherein you stand.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The church that is in Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you: and so doth my son Mark.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Salute one another with a holy kiss. Grace be to all you, who are in Christ Jesus. Amen. </div><ul class='tnav'>
