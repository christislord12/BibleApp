And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Masphath.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Masphath, and the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard this, they were afraid of the Philistines.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And they said to Samuel: Cease not to cry to the Lord our God for us, that he may save us out of the hand of the Philistines.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it whole for a holocaust to the Lord: and Samuel cried to the Lord for Israel, and the Lord heard him.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when Samuel was offering the holocaust, the Philistines began the battle against Israel: but the Lord thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and terrified them, and they were overthrown before the face of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the men of Israel going out of Masphath pursued after the Philistines, and made slaughter of them till they came under Bethchar.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Samuel took a stone, and laid it between Masphath and Sen: and he called the place, the Stone of help. And he said: Thus far the Lord hath helped us.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the Philistines were humbled, and they did not come any more into the borders of Israel. And the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines, all the days of Samuel.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the cities, which the Philistines had taken from Israel, were restored to Israel, from Accaron to Geth, and their borders: and he delivered Israel from the hand of the Philistines, and there was peace between Israel and the Amorrhites.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And he went every year about to Bethel and to Galgal and to Masphath, and he judged Israel in the aforesaid places.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he returned to Ramatha, for there was his house, and there he judged Israel: he built also there an altar to the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
