I will flee then out of his hands.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And David arose and went away, both he and the six hundred men that were with him, to Achis the son of Maoch, king of Geth.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And David dwelt with Achis at Geth, he and his men: every man with his household, and David with his two wives, Achinoam the Jezrahelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal of Carmel.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And it was told Saul that David was fled to Geth, and he sought no more after him.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And David said to Achis: If I have found favour in thy sight, let a place be given me in one of the cities of this country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then Achis gave him Siceleg that day: for which reason Siceleg belongeth to the kings of Juda unto this day.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines, was four months.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And David and his men went up, and pillaged Gessuri, and Gerzi, and the Amalecites: for these were of old the inhabitants of the countries, as men go to Sur, even to the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And David wasted all the land, and left neither man nor woman alive: and took away the sheep and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned and came to Achis.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Achis said to him: Whom hast thou gone against today? David answered: Against the south of Juda, and against the south of Jerameel, and against the south of Ceni.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And David saved neither man nor woman, neither brought he any of them to Geth, saying: Lest they should speak against us. So did David, and such was his proceeding all the days that he dwelt in the country of the Philistines.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Achis believed David, saying: He hath done much harm to his people Israel: therefore he shall be my servant for ever. </div><ul class='tnav'>
