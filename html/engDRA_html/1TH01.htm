We give thanks to God always for you all; making a remembrance of you in our prayers without ceasing,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Being mindful of the work of your faith, and labour, and charity, and of the enduring of the hope of our Lord Jesus Christ before God and our Father:  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Knowing, brethren beloved of God, your election:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For our gospel hath not been unto you in word only, but in power also, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much fulness, as you know what manner of men we have been among you for your sakes.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And you became followers of us, and of the Lord; receiving the word in much tribulation, with joy of the Holy Ghost:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So that you were made a pattern to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For from you was spread abroad the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia, and in Achaia, but also in every place, your faith which is towards God, is gone forth, so that we need not to speak any thing.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For they themselves relate of us, what manner of entering in we had unto you; and how you turned to God from idols, to serve the living and true God.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And to wait for his Son from heaven (whom he raised up from the dead,) Jesus, who hath delivered us from the wrath to come. </div><ul class='tnav'>
