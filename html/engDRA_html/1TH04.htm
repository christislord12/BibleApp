But we entreat you, brethren, that you abound more:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And that you use your endeavour to be quiet, and that you do your own business, and work with your own hands, as we commanded you: and that you walk honestly towards them that are without; and that you want nothing of any man’s.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And we will not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning them that are asleep, that you be not sorrowful, even as others who have no hope.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For if we believe that Jesus died, and rose again; even so them who have slept through Jesus, will God bring with him.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For this we say unto you in the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who remain unto the coming of the Lord, shall not prevent them who have slept.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For the Lord himself shall come down from heaven with commandment, and with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God: and the dead who are in Christ, shall rise first.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then we who are alive, who are left, shall be taken up together with them in the clouds to meet Christ, into the air, and so shall we be always with the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Wherefore, comfort ye one another with these words. </div><ul class='tnav'>
