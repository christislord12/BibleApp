For when they have grown wanton in Christ, they will marry:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Having damnation, because they have made void their first faith.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And withal being idle they learn to go about from house to house: and are not only idle, but tattlers also, and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I will therefore that the younger should marry, bear children, be mistresses of families, give no occasion to the adversary to speak evil.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For some are already turned aside after Satan.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>If any of the faithful have widows, let him minister to them, and let not the church be charged: that there may be sufficient for them that are widows indeed.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Let the priests that rule well, be esteemed worthy of double honour: especially they who labour in the word and doctrine:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For the scripture saith: Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn: and, The labourer is worthy of his reward.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Against a priest receive not an accusation, but under two or three witnesses.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Them that sin reprove before all: that the rest also may have fear.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>I charge thee before God, and Christ Jesus, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by declining to either side.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Impose not hands lightly upon any man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins. Keep thyself chaste.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Do not still drink water, but use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake, and thy frequent infirmities.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Some men’s sins are manifest, going before to judgment: and some men they follow after.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>In like manner also good deeds are manifest: and they that are otherwise, cannot be hid. </div><ul class='tnav'>
