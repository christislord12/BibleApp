These things teach and exhort.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to that doctrine which is according to godliness,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>He is proud, knowing nothing, but sick about questions and strifes of words; from which arise envies, contentions, blasphemies, evil suspicions,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Conflicts of men corrupted in mind, and who are destitute of the truth, supposing gain to be godliness.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But godliness with contentment is great gain.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For we brought nothing into this world: and certainly we can carry nothing out.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But having food, and wherewith to be covered, with these we are content.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For they that will become rich, fall into temptation, and into the snare of the devil, and into many unprofitable and hurtful desires, which drown men into destruction and perdition.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For the desire of money is the root of all evils; which some coveting have erred from the faith, and have entangled themselves in many sorrows.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But thou, O man of God, fly these things: and pursue justice, godliness, faith, charity, patience, mildness.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Fight the good fight of faith: lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art called, and hast confessed a good confession before many witnesses.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I charge thee before God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, who gave testimony under Pontius Pilate, a good confession,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>That thou keep the commandment without spot, blameless, unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Which in his times he shall shew who is the Blessed and only Mighty, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Who only hath immortality, and inhabiteth light inaccessible, whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and empire everlasting. Amen.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Charge the rich of this world not to be highminded, nor to trust in the uncertainty of riches, but in the living God, (who giveth us abundantly all things to enjoy,)  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>To do good, to be rich in good works, to give easily, to communicate to others,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>To lay up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on the true life.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding the profane novelties of words, and oppositions of knowledge falsely so called.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Which some promising, have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen. </div><ul class='tnav'>
