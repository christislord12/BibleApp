Also a hundred bowls of gold.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>He made also the court of the priests, and a great hall, and doors in the hall, which he covered with brass.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And he set the sea on the right side over against the east toward the south.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Hiram made caldrons, and fleshhooks, and bowls: and finished all the king’s work in the house of God:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>That is to say, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the chapiters, and the network, to cover the chapiters over the pommels.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And four hundred pomegranates, and two wreaths of network, so that two rows of pomegranates were joined to each wreath, to cover the pommels, and the chapiters of the pillars.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He made also bases, and lavers, which he set upon the bases:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>One sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the caldrons, and fleshhooks, and bowls. All the vessels did Hiram his father make for Solomon in the house of the Lord of the finest brass.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>In the country near the Jordan did the king cast them, in a clay ground between Sochot and Saredatha.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the multitude of vessels was innumerable, so that the weight of the brass was not known.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Solomon made all the vessels for the house of God, and the golden altar, and the tables, upon which were the leaves of proposition,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The candlesticks also of most pure gold with their lamps to give light before the oracle, according to the manner.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And certain flowers, and lamps, and golden tongs: all were made of the finest gold.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The vessels also for the perfumes, and the censers, and the bowls, and the mortars, of pure gold. And he graved the doors of the inner temple, that is, for the holy of holies: and the doors of the temple without were of gold. And thus all the work was finished which Solomon made in the house of the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
