If heaven and the heavens of heavens do not contain thee, how much less this house, which I have built?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But to this end only it is made, that thou mayest regard the prayer of thy servant and his supplication, O Lord my God: and mayest hear the prayers which thy servant poureth out before thee.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>That thou mayest open thy eyes upon this house day and night, upon the place wherein thou hast promised that thy name should be called upon,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And that thou wouldst hear the prayer which thy servant prayeth in it: hearken then to the prayers of thy servant, and of thy people Israel. Whosoever shall pray in this place, hear thou from thy dwelling place, that is, from heaven, and shew mercy.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>If any man sin against his neighbour, and come to swear against him, and bind himself with a curse before the altar in this house:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then hear thou from heaven, and do justice to thy servants, so as to requite the wicked by making his wickedness fall upon his own head, and to revenge the just, rewarding him according to his justice.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>If thy people Israel be overcome by their enemies, (for they will sin against thee,) and being converted shall do penance, and call upon thy name, and pray to thee in this place,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them back into the land, which thou gavest to them, and their fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>If the heavens be shut up, and there fall no rain by reason of the sins of the people, and they shall pray to thee in this place, and confess to thy name, and be converted from their sins, when thou dost afflict them,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then hear thou from heaven, O Lord, and forgive the sins of thy servants and of thy people Israel, and teach them the good way, in which they may walk: and give rain to thy land which thou hast given to thy people to possess.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>If a famine arise in the land, or a pestilence or blasting, or mildew, or locusts, or caterpillars: or if their enemies waste the country, and besiege the cities, whatsoever scourge or infirmity shall be upon them:  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Then if any of thy people Israel, knowing his own scourge and infirmity shall pray, and shall spread forth his hands in this house,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Hear thou from heaven, from thy high dwelling place, and forgive, and render to every one according to his ways, which thou knowest him to have in his heart: (for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men:)  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>That they may fear thee, and walk in thy ways all the days that they live upon the face of the land, which thou hast given to our fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>If the stranger also, who is not of thy people Israel, come from a far country, for the sake of thy great name, and thy strong hand, and thy stretched out arm, and adore in this place:  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Hear thou from heaven thy firm dwelling place, and do all that which that stranger shall call upon thee for: that all the people of the earth may know thy name, and may fear thee, as thy people Israel, and may know, that thy name is invoked upon this house, which I have built.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>If thy people go out to war against their enemies, by the way that thou shalt send them, and adore thee towards the way of this city, which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built to thy name:  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Then hear thou from heaven their prayers, and their supplications, and revenge them.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And if they sin against thee (for there is no man that sinneth not) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them up to their enemies, and they lead them away captive to a land either afar off, or near at hand,  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And if they be converted in their heart in the land to which they were led captive, and do penance, and pray to thee in the land of their captivity, saying: We have sinned, we have done wickedly, we have dealt unjustly:  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And return to thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their captivity, to which they were led away, and adore thee towards the way of their own land which thou gavest their fathers, and of the city, which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built to thy name:  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Then hear thou from heaven, that is, from thy firm dwelling place, their prayers, and do judgment, and forgive thy people, although they have sinned:  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>For thou art my God: let thy eyes, I beseech thee, be open, and let thy ears be attentive to the prayer, that is made in this place.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Now therefore arise, O Lord God, into thy resting place, thou and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O Lord God, put on salvation, and thy saints rejoice in good things.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>O Lord God, turn not away the face of thy anointed: remember the mercies of David thy servant. </div><ul class='tnav'>
