And while he stood facing the enemies, he encompassed Juda. who perceived it not, with his army.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And when Juda looked back, they saw the battle coming upon them both before and behind, and they cried to the Lord: and the priests began to sound with the trumpets.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And all the men of Juda shouted: and behold when they shouted, God terrified Jeroboam, and all Israel that stood against Abia and Juda.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the children of Israel fled before Juda, and the Lord delivered them into their hand.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Abia and his people slew them with a great slaughter, and there fell wounded of Israel five hundred thousand valiant men.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the children of Israel were brought down, at that time, and the children of Juda were exceedingly strengthened, because they had trusted in the Lord the God of their fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Abia pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel and her daughters, and Jesana with her daughters, Ephron also and her daughters.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Jeroboam was not able to resist any more, in the days of Abia: and the Lord struck him, and he died.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But Abia, being strengthened in his kingdom, took fourteen wives: and begot two and twenty sons, and sixteen daughters.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the rest of the acts of Abia, and of his ways and works, are written diligently in the book of Addo the prophet. </div><ul class='tnav'>
