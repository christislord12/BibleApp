So they built, and there was no hinderance in building.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Asa had in his army of men that bore shields and spears of Juda three hundred thousand, and of Benjamin that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred and eighty thousand, all these were most valiant men.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Zara the Ethiopian came out against them with his army of ten hundred thousand men, and with three hundred chariots: and he came as far as Maresa.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Asa went out to meet him, and set his army in array for battle in the vale of Sephata, which is near Maresa:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And he called upon the Lord God, and said: O Lord, there is no difference with thee, whether thou help with few, or with many: help us, O Lord our God: for with confidence in thee, and in thy name, we are come against this multitude. O Lord thou art our God, let not man prevail against thee.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the Lord terrified the Ethiopians before Asa and Juda: and the Ethiopians fled.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them to Gerara: and the Ethiopians fell even to utter destruction, for the Lord slew them, and his army fought against them, and they were destroyed. And they took abundance of spoils,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And they took all the cities round about Gerara: for a great fear was come upon all men: and they pillaged the cities, and carried off much booty.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And they destroyed the sheepcotes, and took an infinite number of cattle, and of camels: and returned to Jerusalem. </div><ul class='tnav'>
