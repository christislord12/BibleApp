Wherefore thou hast done foolishly, and for this cause from this time wars shall arise against thee.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Asa was angry with the seer, and commanded him to be put in prison: for he was greatly enraged because of this thing: and he put to death many of the people at that time.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But the works of Asa the first and last are written in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Asa fell sick in the nine and thirtieth year of his reign, of a most violent pain in his feet, and yet in his illness he did not seek the Lord, but rather trusted in the skill of physicians.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And he slept with his fathers: and he died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And they buried him in his own sepulchre, which he had made for himself in the city of David: and they laid him on his bed full of spices and odoriferous ointments, which were made by the art of the perfumers, and they burnt them over him with very great pomp. </div><ul class='tnav'>
