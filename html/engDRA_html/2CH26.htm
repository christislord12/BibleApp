And presently there rose a leprosy in his forehead before the priests, in the house of the Lord at the altar of incense.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Azarias the high priest, and all the rest of the priests looked upon him, and saw the leprosy in his forehead, and they made haste to thrust him out. Yea himself also being frightened, hasted to go out, because he had quickly felt the stroke of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Ozias the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and he dwelt in a house apart being full of the leprosy, for which he had been cast out of the house of the Lord. And Joatham his son governed the king’s house, and judged the people of the land.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But the rest of the acts of Ozias first and last were written by Isaias the son of Amos, the prophet.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Ozias slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the field of the royal sepulchres, because he was a leper: and Joatham his son reigned in his stead. </div><ul class='tnav'>
