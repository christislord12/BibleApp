For, what I have pardoned, if I have pardoned any thing, for your sakes have I done it in the person of Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>That we be not overreached by Satan. For we are not ignorant of his devices.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And when I was come to Troas for the gospel of Christ, and a door was opened unto me in the Lord,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother; but bidding them farewell, I went into Macedonia.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Now thanks be to God, who always maketh us to triumph in Christ Jesus, and manifesteth the odour of his knowledge by us in every place.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For we are the good odour of Christ unto God, in them that are saved, and in them that perish.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>To the one indeed the odour of death unto death: but to the others the odour of life unto life. And for these things who is so sufficient?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For we are not as many, adulterating the word of God; but with sincerity, but as from God, before God, in Christ we speak. </div><ul class='tnav'>
