Behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Giving no offence to any man, that our ministry be not blamed:  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But in all things let us exhibit ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in tribulation, in necessities, in distresses,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>In stripes, in prisons, in seditions, in labours, in watchings, in fastings,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>In chastity, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in sweetness, in the Holy Ghost, in charity unfeigned,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>In the word of truth, in the power of God; by the armour of justice on the right hand and on the left;  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true; as unknown, and yet known;  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>As dying, and behold we live; as chastised, and not killed;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as needy, yet enriching many; as having nothing, and possessing all things.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Our mouth is open to you, O ye Corinthians, our heart is enlarged.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>You are not straitened in us, but in your own bowels you are straitened.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But having the same recompense, (I speak as to my children,) be you also enlarged.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Bear not the yoke with unbelievers. For what participation hath justice with injustice? Or what fellowship hath light with darkness?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And what concord hath Christ with Belial? Or what part hath the faithful with the unbeliever?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God; as God saith: I will dwell in them, and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Wherefore, Go out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And I will receive you; and I will be a Father to you; and you shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty. </div><ul class='tnav'>
