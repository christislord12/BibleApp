<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 7</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of the flesh and of the spirit, perfecting sactification in the fear of God.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Receive us. We have injured no man, we have corrupted no man, we have overreached no man.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I speak not this to your condemnation. For we have said before, that you are in our hearts, to die together, and to live together.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Great is my confidence for you, great is my glorying for you. I am filled with comfort: I exceedingly abound with joy in all our tribulation.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For also when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we suffered all tribulation; combats without, fears within.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But God, who comforteth the humble, comforted us by the coming of Titus.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And not by his coming only, but also by the consolation, wherewith he was comforted in you, relating to us your desire, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced the more.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For although I made you sorrowful by my epistle, I do not repent; and if I did repent, seeing that the same epistle (although but for a time) did make you sorrowful;  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Now I am glad: not because you were made sorrowful; but because you were made sorrowful unto penance. For you were made sorrowful according to God, that you might suffer damage by us in nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For the sorrow that is according to God worketh penance, steadfast unto salvation; but the sorrow of the world worketh death.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For behold this selfsame thing, that you were made sorrowful according to God, how great carefulness it worketh in you; yea defence, yea indignation, yea fear, yea desire, yea zeal, yea revenge: in all things you have shewed yourselves to be undefiled in the matter.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Wherefore although I wrote to you, it was not for his sake that I did the wrong, nor for him that suffered it; but to manifest our carefulness that we have for you  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Before God: therefore we were comforted. But in our consolation, we did the more abundantly rejoice for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I have not been put to shame; but as we have spoken all things to you in truth, so also our boasting that was made to Titus is found a truth.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And his bowels are more abundantly towards you; remembering the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you have received him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I rejoice that in all things I have confidence in you. </div><ul class='tnav'>
