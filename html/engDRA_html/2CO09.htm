<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 9</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>For concerning the ministry that is done towards the saints, it is superfluous for me to write unto you.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>For I know your forward mind: for which I boast of you to the Macedonians. That Achaia also is ready from the year past, and your emulation hath provoked very many.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Now I have sent the brethren, that the thing which we boast of concerning you, be not made void in this behalf, that (as I have said) you may be ready:  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Lest, when the Macedonians shall come with me, and find you unprepared, we (not to say ye) should be ashamed in this matter.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Therefore I thought it necessary to desire the brethren that they would go to you before, and prepare this blessing before promised, to be ready, so as a blessing, not as covetousness.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Now this I say: He who soweth sparingly, shall also reap sparingly: and he who soweth in blessings, shall also reap blessings.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Every one as he hath determined in his heart, not with sadness, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And God is able to make all grace abound in you; that ye always, having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>As it is written: He hath dispersed abroad, he hath given to the poor: his justice remaineth for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And he that ministereth seed to the sower, will both give you bread to eat, and will multiply your seed, and increase the growth of the fruits of your justice:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>That being enriched in all things, you may abound unto all simplicity, which worketh through us thanksgiving to God.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Because the administration of this office doth not only supply the want of the saints, but aboundeth also by many thanksgivings in the Lord,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>By the proof of this ministry, glorifying God for the obedience of your confession unto the gospel of Christ, and for the simplicity of your communicating unto them, and unto all.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And in their praying for you, being desirous of you, because of the excellent grace of God in you.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift. </div><ul class='tnav'>
