If any man trust to himself, that he is Christ’s, let him think this again with himself, that as he is Christ’s, so are we also.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For if also I should boast somewhat more of our power, which the Lord hath given us unto edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But that I may not be thought as it were to terrify you by epistles,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>(For his epistles indeed, say they, are weighty and strong; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible,)  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Let such a one think this, that such as we are in word by epistles, when absent, such also we will be indeed when present.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For we dare not match, or compare ourselves with some, that commend themselves; but we measure ourselves by ourselves, and compare ourselves with ourselves.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But we will not glory beyond our measure; but according to the measure of the rule, which God hath measured to us, a measure to reach even unto you.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as if we reached not unto you. For we are come as far as to you in the gospel of Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Not glorying beyond measure in other men’s labours; but having hope of your increasing faith, to be magnified in you according to our rule abundantly;  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Yea, unto those places that are beyond you, to preach the gospel, not to glory in another man’s rule, in those things that are made ready to our hand.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For not he who commendeth himself, is approved, but he, whom God commendeth. </div><ul class='tnav'>
