For we also are weak in him: but we shall live with him by the power of God towards you.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Try your own selves if you be in the faith; prove ye yourselves. Know you not your own selves, that Christ Jesus is in you, unless perhaps you be reprobates?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But I trust that you shall know that we are not reprobates.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Now we pray God, that you may do no evil, not that we may appear approved, but that you may do that which is good, and that we may be as reprobates.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For we can do nothing against the truth; but for the truth.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For we rejoice that we are weak, and you are strong. This also we pray for, your perfection.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Therefore I write these things, being absent, that, being present, I may not deal more severely, according to the power which the Lord hath given me unto edification, and not unto destruction.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For the rest, brethren, rejoice, be perfect, take exhortation, be of one mind, have peace; and the God of peace and of love shall be with you.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Salute one another with a holy kiss. All the saints salute you.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the charity of God, and the communication of the Holy Ghost be with you all. Amen. </div><ul class='tnav'>
