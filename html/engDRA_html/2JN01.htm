For this is the commandment, that, as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk in the same:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For many seducers are gone out into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh: this is a seducer and an antichrist.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Look to yourselves, that you lose not the things which you have wrought: but that you may receive a full reward.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Whosoever revolteth, and continueth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that continueth in the doctrine, the same hath both the Father and the Son.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>If any man come to you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into the house nor say to him, God speed you.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For he that saith unto him, God speed you, communicateth with his wicked works.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Having more things to write unto you, I would not by paper and ink: for I hope that I shall be with you, and speak face to face: that your joy may be full.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The children of thy sister Elect salute thee. </div><ul class='tnav'>
