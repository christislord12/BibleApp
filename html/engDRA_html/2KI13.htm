But Joas was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Now Eliseus was sick of the illness whereof he died: and Joas king of Israel went down to him, and wept before him, and said: O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel and the guider thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Eliseus said to him: Bring a bow and arrows. And when he had brought him a bow, and arrows,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He said to the king of Israel: Put thy hand upon the bow. And when he had put his hand, Eliseus put his hands over the king’s hands,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And said: Open the window to the east. And when he had opened it, Eliseus said: Shoot an arrow. And he shot. And Eliseus said: The arrow of the Lord’s deliverance, and the arrow of the deliverance from Syria: and thou shalt strike the Syrians in Aphec, till thou consume them.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he said: Take the arrows. And when he had taken them, he said to him: Strike with an arrow upon the ground. And he struck three times and stood still.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the man of God was angry with him, and said: If thou hadst smitten five or six or seven times, thou hadst smitten Syria even to utter destruction: but now three times shalt thou smite it.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Eliseus died, and they buried him. And the rovers from Moab came into the land the same year.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And some that were burying a man, saw the rovers, and cast the body into the sepulchre of Eliseus. And when it had touched the bones of Eliseus, the man came to life, and stood upon his feet.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Now Hazael king of Syria afflicted Israel all the days of Joachaz:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the Lord had mercy on them, and returned to them because of his covenant, which he had made with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob: and he would not destroy them, nor utterly cast them away, unto this present time.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Hazael king of Syria died, and Benadad his son reigned in his stead.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Now Joas the son of Joachaz, took the cities out of the hand of Benadad, the son of Hazael, which he had taken out of the hand of Joachaz his father by war, three times did Joas beat him, and he restored the cities to Israel. </div><ul class='tnav'>
