And I have entered into the furthest parts thereof, and the forest of its Carmel.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>I have cut down, and I have drunk strange waters, and have dried up with the soles of my feet all the shut up waters.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Hast thou not heard what I have done from the beginning? from the days of old I have formed it, and now I have brought it to effect: that fenced cities of fighting men should be turned to heaps of ruin:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the inhabitants of them, were weak of hand, they trembled and were confounded, they became like the grass of the field, and the green herb on the tops of houses, which withered before it came to maturity.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Thy dwelling and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy way I knew before, and thy rage against me.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Thou hast been mad against me, and thy pride hath come up to my ears: therefore I will put a ring in thy nose, and a bit between thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way, by which thou camest.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And to thee, O Ezechias, this shall be a sign: Eat this year what thou shalt find: and in the second year, such things as spring of themselves: but in the third year sow and reap: plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And whatsoever shall be left of the house of Juda, shall take root downward, and bear fruit upward.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and that which shall be saved out of mount Sion: the zeal of the Lord of hosts shall do this.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Wherefore thus saith the Lord concerning the king of the Assyrians: He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow into it, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a trench about it.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>By the way that he came, he shall return: and into this city he shall not come, saith the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And I will protect this city, and will save it for my own sake, and for David my servant’s sake.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And it came to pass that night, that an angel of the Lord came, and slew in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand. And when he arose early in the morning, he saw all the bodies of the dead.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And Sennacherib king of the Assyrians departing went away, and he returned and abode in Ninive.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And as he was worshipping in the temple of Nesroch his god, Adramelech and Sarasar his sons slew him with the sword, and they fled into the land of the Armenians, and Asarhaddon his son reigned in his stead. </div><ul class='tnav'>
