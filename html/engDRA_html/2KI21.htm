 <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Manasses slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Oza: and Amen his son reigned in his stead.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Two and twenty years old was Amen when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Messalemeth the daughter of Harus of Jeteba.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he did evil in the sight, of the Lord, as Manasses his father had done.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he walked in all the way in which his father had walked: and he served the abominations which his father had served, and he adored them;  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And forsook the Lord the God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And his servants plotted against him, and slew the king in his own house.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amen: and made Josias his son their king in his stead.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But the rest of the acts of Amen which he did, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Juda?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And they buried him in his sepulchre in the garden of Oza: and his son Josias reigned in his stead. </div><ul class='tnav'>
