And Joakim slept with his fathers:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Joachin his son reigned in his stead.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his own country: for the king of Babylon had taken all that had belonged to the king of Egypt, from the river of Egypt, unto the river Euphrates.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Joachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, a and he reigned three months in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Nohesta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he did evil before the Lord, according to all that his father had done.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>At that time the servants of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city was surrounded with their forts.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon came to the city with his servants to assault it.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Joachin king of Juda went out to the king of Babylon, he and his mother, and his servants, and his nobles, and his eunuchs: and the king of Babylon received him in the eighth year of his reign.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And he brought out from thence all the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king’s house: and he cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the Lord, according to the word of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the valiant men of the army, to the number of ten thousand into captivity: and every artificer and smith: and none were left, but the poor sort of the people of the land.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he carried away Joachin into Babylon, and the king’s mother, and the king’s wives, and his eunuchs: and the judges of the land he carried into captivity from Jerusalem into Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And all the strong men, seven thousand, and the artificers, and the smiths a thousand, all that were valiant men and fit for war: and the king of Babylon led them captives into Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he appointed Matthanias his uncle in his stead: and called his name Sedecias.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Sedecias was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Amital, the daughter of Jeremias of Lobna.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he did evil before the Lord, according to all that Joakim had done.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For the Lord was angry against Jerusalem and against Juda, till he cast them out from his face: and Sedecias revolted from the king of Babylon. </div><ul class='tnav'>
