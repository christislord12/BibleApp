but the bearers thereof desired it might not be bestowed on the sacrifices, because it was not necessary, but might be deputed for other charges.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>So the money was appointed by him that sent it to the sacrifice of Hercules: but because of them that carried it was employed for the making of galleys.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Now when Apollonius the son of Mnestheus was sent into Egypt to treat with the nobles of king Philometor, and Antiochus understood that he was wholly excluded from the affairs of the kingdom, consulting his own interest, he departed thence and came to Joppe, and from thence to Jerusalem:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Where he was received in a, magnificent manner by Jason, and the city, and came in with torch lights, and with praises, and from thence he returned with his army into Phenicia.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Three years afterwards Jason sent Menelaus, brother of the aforesaid Simon, to carry money to the king, and to bring answers from him concerning certain necessary affairs.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But he being recommended to the king, when he had magnified the appearance of his power, got the high priesthood for himself, by offering more than Jason by three hundred talents of silver.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>So having received the king’s mandate, he returned bringing nothing worthy of the high priesthood: but having the mind of a cruel tyrant, and the rage of a savage beast.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then Jason, who had undermined his own brother, being himself undermined, was driven out a fugitive into the country of the Ammonites.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>So Menelaus got the principality: but as for the money he had promised to the king he took no care, when Sostratus the governor of the castle called for it.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For to him appertained the gathering of the taxes: wherefore they were both called before the king.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Menelaus was removed from the priesthood, Lysimachus his brother succeeding: and Sostratus was made governor of the Cyprians.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>When these things were in doing, it fell out that they of Tharsus and Mallos raised a sedition, because they were given for a gift to Antiochis, the king’s concubine.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The king therefore went in all haste to appease them, leaving Andronicus, one of his nobles, for his deputy.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Then Menelaus supposing that he had found a convenient time, having stolen certain vessels of gold out of the temple, gave them to Andronicus, and others he had sold at Tyre, and in the neighbouring cities.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Which when Onias understood most certainly, he reproved him, keeping himself in a safe place at Antioch beside Daphne.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Whereupon Menelaus coming to Andronicus, desired him to kill Onias. And he went to Onias, and gave him his right hand with an oath, and (though he were suspected by him) persuaded him to come forth out of the sanctuary, and immediately slew him, without any regard to justice.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>For which cause not only the Jews, but also the other nations, conceived indignation, and were much grieved for the unjust murder of so great a man.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And when the king was come back from the places of Cilicia, the Jews that were at Antioch, and also the Creaks went to him: complaining of the unjust murder of Onias.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Antiochus therefore was grieved in his mind for Onias, and being moved to pity, shed tears, remembering the sobriety and modesty of the deceased.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And being inflamed to anger, he commanded Andronicus to be stripped of his purple, and to be led about through all the city: and that in the same place wherein he had committed the impiety against Onias, the sacrilegious wretch should be put to death, the Lord repaying him his deserved punishment.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Now when many sacrileges had been committed by Lysimachus in the temple by the counsel of Menelaus, and the rumour of it was spread abroad, the multitude gathered themselves together against Lysimachus, a great quantity of gold being already carried away.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Wherefore the multitude making an insurrection, and their minds being filled with anger, Lysimachus armed about three thousand men, and began to use violence, one Tyrannus being captain, a man far gone both in age, and in madness.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>But when they perceived the attempt of Lysimachus, some caught up stones, some strong clubs: and some threw ashes upon Lysimachus,  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And many of them were wounded, and some struck down to the ground, but all were put to flight: and as for the sacrilegious fellow himself, they slew him beside the treasury.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Now concerning these matters, an accusation was laid against Menelaus.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And when the king was come to Tyre, three men were sent from the ancients to plead the cause before him.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>But Menelaus being convicted, promised Ptolemee to give him much money to persuade the king to favour him.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>So Ptolemee went to the king in a certain court where he was, as it were to cool himself, and brought him to be of another mind:  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>So Menelaus who was guilty of all the evil, was acquitted by him of the accusations: and those poor men, who, if they had pleaded their cause even before Scythians, should have been judged innocent, were condemned to death.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Thus they that prosecuted the cause for the city, and for the people, and the sacred vessels, did soon suffer unjust punishment.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Wherefore even the Tyrians being moved with indignation, were liberal towards their burial.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>And so through the covetousness of them that were in power, Menelaus continued in authority, increasing in malice to the betraying of the citizens. </div><ul class='tnav'>
