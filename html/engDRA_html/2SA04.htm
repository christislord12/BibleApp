And his nurse took him up and fled: and as she made haste to flee, he fell and became lame: and his name was Miphiboseth.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the sons of Remmon the Berothite, Rechab and Baana coming, went into the house of Isboseth in the heat of the day: and he was sleeping upon his bed at noon. And the doorkeeper of the house, who was cleansing wheat, was fallen asleep.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And they entered into the house secretly taking ears of corn, and Rechab and Baana his brother stabbed him in the groin, and fled away.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For when they came into the house, be was sleeping upon his bed in a parlour, and they struck him and killed him: and taking away his head they went off by the way of the wilderness, walking all night.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And they brought the head of Isboseth to David to Hebron: and they said to the king: Behold the head of Isboseth the son of Saul thy enemy who sought thy life: and the Lord hath revenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But David answered Rechab, and Baana his brother, the sons of Remmon the Berothite, and said to them: As the Lord liveth, who hath delivered my soul out of all distress,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The man that told me, and said: Saul is dead, who thought he brought good tidings, I apprehended, and slew him in Siceleg, who should have been rewarded for his news.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>How much more now when wicked men have slain an innocent man in his own house, upon his bed, shall I not require his blood at your hand, and take you away from the earth?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And David commanded his servants and they slew them: and cutting off their hands and feet, hanged them up over the pool in Hebron: but the head of Isboseth they took and buried in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron. </div><ul class='tnav'>
