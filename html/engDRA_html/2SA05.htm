And the Lord said to David: Go up, for I will surely deliver the Philistines into thy hand.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And David came to Baal Pharisim: and defeated them there, and he said: The Lord hath divided my enemies before me, as waters are divided. Therefore the name of the place was called Baal Pharisim.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And they left there their idols: which David and his men took away.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the Philistines came up again and spread themselves in the valley of Raphaim.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And David consulted the Lord: Shall I go up against the Philistines, and wilt thou deliver them into my hands? He answered: Go not up against them, but fetch a compass behind them, and thou shalt come upon them over against the pear trees.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And when thou shalt hear the sound of one going in the tops of the pear trees, then shalt thou join battle: for then will the Lord go out before thy face to strike the army of the Philistines.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And David did as the Lord had commanded him, and he smote the Philistines from Gabaa until thou come to Gezer. </div><ul class='tnav'>
