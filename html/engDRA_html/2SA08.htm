For Thou was an enemy to Adarezer, and in his hand were vessels of gold, and vessels of silver, and vessels of brass:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And king David dedicated them to the Lord, together with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all the nations, which he had subdued:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalec, and of the spoils of Adarezer the son of Rohob king of Soba.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>David also made himself a name, when he returned after taking Syria in the valley of the saltpits, killing eighteen thousand:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he put guards in Edom, and placed there a garrison: and all Edom was made to serve David: and the Lord preserved David in all enterprises he went about.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And David reigned over all Israel: and David did judgment and justice to all his people.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Joab the son of Sarvia was over the army: and Josaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Sadoc the son of Achitob, and Achimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests: and Saraias was the scribe:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Banaias the son of Joiada was over the Cerethi and Phelethi: and the sons of David were the princes. </div><ul class='tnav'>
