So David sent his servants to comfort him for the death of his father. But when the servants of David were come into the land of the children of Ammon,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanon their lord: Thinkest thou that for the honour of thy father, David hath sent comforters to thee, and hath not David rather sent his servants to thee to search, and spy into the city, and overthrow it?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Wherefore Hanon took the servants of David, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut away half of their garments even to the buttocks, and sent them away.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>When this was told David, he sent to meet them: for the men were sadly put to confusion, and David commanded them, saying: Stay at Jericho, till your beards be grown, and then return.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the children of Ammon seeing that they had done an injury to David, Bent and hired the Syrians of Rohob, and the Syrians of Soba, twenty thousand footmen, and of the king of Maacha a thousand men, and of Istob twelve thousand men.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And when David heard this, he sent Joab and the whole army of warriors.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the children of Ammon came out, and set their men in array at the entering in of the gate: but the Syrians of Soba, and of Rohob, and of Istob, and of Maacha were by themselves in the field.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then Joab seeing that the battle was prepared against him, both before and behind, chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the rest of the people he delivered to Abisai his brother, who set them in array against the children of Ammon.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Joab said: If the Syrians are too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon are too strong for thee, then I will help thee.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Be of good courage, and let us fight for our people, and for the city of our God: and the Lord will do what is good in his sight.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Joab and the people that were with him, began to fight against the Syrians: and they immediately fled before him.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the children of Ammon seeing that the Syrians were fled, they fled also before Abisai, and entered into the city: and Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then the Syrians seeing that they had fallen before Israel, gathered themselves together.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Adarezer sent and fetched the Syrians, that were beyond the river, and brought over their army: and Sobach, the captain of the host of Adarezer, was their general.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And when this was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came to Helam: and the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought against him.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the Syrians fled before Israel, and David slew of the Syrians the men of seven hundred chariots, and forty thousand horsemen: and smote Sobach the captain of the army, who presently died.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And all the kings that were auxiliaries of Adarezer, seeing themselves overcome by Israel, were afraid and fled away, eight and fifty thousand men before Israel. And they made peace with Israel: and served them, and all the Syrians were afraid to help the children of Ammon any more. </div><ul class='tnav'>
