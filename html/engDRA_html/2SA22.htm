 <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>God who hath girded me with strength, and made my way perfect.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Making my feet like the feet of harts, and setting me upon my high places.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>He teacheth my bands to war: and maketh my arms like a bow of brass.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Thou hast given me the shield of my salvation: and thy mildness hath multiplied me.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Thou shalt enlarge my steps under me: and my ankles shall not fail.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>I will pursue after my enemies, and crush them: and will not return again till I consume them.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>I will consume them and break them in pieces, so that they shall not rise: they shall fall under my feet.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Thou hast girded me with strength to battle: thou hast made them that resisted me to bow under me.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>My enemies thou hast made to turn their back to me: them that hated me, and I shall destroy them.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>They shall cry, and there shall be none to save: to the Lord, and he shall not hear them.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>I shall beat them as small as the dust of the earth: I shall crush them and spread them abroad like the mire of the streets.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Thou wilt save me from the contradictions of my people: thou wilt keep me to be the head of the Gentiles: the people which I know not, shall serve me,  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>The sons of the stranger will resist me, at the hearing of the ear they will obey me.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>The strangers are melted away, and shall be straitened in their distresses.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>The Lord liveth, and my God is blessed: and the strong God of my salvation shall be exalted:  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>God who giveth me revenge, and bringest down people under me,  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Who bringest me forth from my enemies, and liftest me up from them that resist me: from the wicked man thou shalt deliver me.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Therefore will I give thanks to thee. O Lord, among the Gentiles, and will sing to thy name.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Giving great salvation to his king, and shewing mercy to David his anointed, and to his seed for ever. </div><ul class='tnav'>
