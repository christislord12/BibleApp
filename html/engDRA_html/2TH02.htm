Therefore God shall send them the operation of error, to believe lying:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>That all may be judged who have not believed the truth, but have consented to iniquity.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But we ought to give thanks to God always for you, brethren, beloved of God, for that God hath chosen you firstfruits unto salvation, in sanctification of the spirit, and faith of the truth:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Whereunto also he hath called you by our gospel, unto the purchasing of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Therefore, brethren, stand fast; and hold the traditions which you have learned, whether by word, or by our epistle.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God and our Father, who hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation, and good hope in grace,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Exhort your hearts, and confirm you in every good work and word. </div><ul class='tnav'>
