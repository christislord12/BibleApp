If we deny him, he will also deny us.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>If we believe not, he continueth faithful, he can not deny himself.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Of these things put them in mind, charging them before the Lord. Contend not in words, for it is to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Carefully study to present thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But shun profane and vain babblings: for they grow much towards ungodliness.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And their speech spreadeth like a canker: of whom are Hymeneus and Philetus:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Who have erred from the truth, saying, that the resurrection is past already, and have subverted the faith of some.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But the sure foundation of God standeth firm, having this seal: the Lord knoweth who are his; and let every one depart from iniquity who nameth the name of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and earth: and some indeed unto honour, but some unto dishonour.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>If any man therefore shall cleanse himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified and profitable to the Lord, prepared unto every good work.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But flee thou youthful desires, and pursue justice, faith, charity, and peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And avoid foolish and unlearned questions, knowing that they beget strifes.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But the servant of the Lord must not wrangle: but be mild towards all men, apt to teach, patient,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>With modesty admonishing them that resist the truth: if peradventure God may give them repentance to know the truth,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And they may recover themselves from the snares of the devil, by whom they are held captive at his will. </div><ul class='tnav'>
