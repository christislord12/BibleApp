Now these avoid.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For of these sort are they who creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, who are led away with divers desires:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Ever learning, and never attaining to the knowledge of the truth.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Now as Jannes and Mambres resisted Moses, so these also resist the truth, men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But they shall proceed no farther; for their folly shall be manifest to all men, as theirs also was.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Persecutions, afflictions: such as came upon me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra: what persecutions I endured, and out of them all the Lord delivered me.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And all that will live godly in Christ Jesus, shall suffer persecution.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But evil men and seducers shall grow worse and worse: erring, and driving into error.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But continue thou in those things which thou hast learned, and which have been committed to thee: knowing of whom thou hast learned them;  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And because from thy infancy thou hast known the holy scriptures, which can instruct thee to salvation, by the faith which is in Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>All scripture, inspired of God, is profitable to teach, to reprove, to correct, to instruct in justice,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>That the man of God may be perfect, furnished to every good work. </div><ul class='tnav'>
