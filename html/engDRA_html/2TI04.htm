Be sober.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For I am even now ready to be sacrificed: and the time of my dissolution is at hand.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>As to the rest, there is laid up for me a crown of justice, which the Lord the just judge will render to me in that day: and not only to me, but to them also that love his coming. Make haste to come to me quickly.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For Demas hath left me, loving this world, and is gone to Thessalonica:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Crescens into Galatia, Titus into Dalmatia.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The cloak that I left at Troas, with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, especially the parchments.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Alexander the coppersmith hath done me much evil: the Lord will reward him according to his works:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Whom do thou also avoid, for he hath greatly withstood our words.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>At my first answer no man stood with me, but all forsook me: may it not be laid to their charge.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that by me the preaching may be accomplished, and that all the Gentiles may hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The Lord hath delivered me from every evil work: and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Erastus remained at Corinth. And Trophimus I left sick at Miletus.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Make haste to come before winter Eubulus and Pudens, and Linus and Claudia, and all the brethren, salute thee.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen. </div><ul class='tnav'>
