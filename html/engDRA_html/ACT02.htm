For neither was he left in hell, neither did his flesh see corruption.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>This Jesus hath God raised again, whereof all we are witnesses.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Being exalted therefore by the right hand of God, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath poured forth this which you see and hear.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>For David ascended not into heaven; but he himself said: The Lord said to my Lord, sit thou on my right hand,  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Until I make thy enemies thy footstool.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Therefore let all the house of Israel know most certainly, that God hath made both Lord and Christ, this same Jesus, whom you have crucified.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Now when they had heard these things, they had compunction in their heart, and said to Peter, and to the rest of the apostles: What shall we do, men and brethren?  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>But Peter said to them: Do penance, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of your sins: and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all that are far off, whomsoever the Lord our God shall call.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And with very many other words did he testify and exhort them, saying: Save yourselves from this perverse generation.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>They therefore that received his word, were baptized; and there were added in that day about three thousand souls.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And they were persevering in the doctrine of the apostles, and in the communication of the breaking of bread, and in prayers.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And fear came upon every soul: many wonders also and signs were done by the apostles in Jerusalem, and there was great fear in all.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And all they that believed, were together, and had all things common.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Their possessions and goods they sold, and divided them to all, according as every one had need.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they took their meat with gladness and simplicity of heart;  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord increased daily together such as should be saved. </div><ul class='tnav'>
