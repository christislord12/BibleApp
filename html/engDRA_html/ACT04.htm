For there is no other name under heaven given to men, whereby we must be saved.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Now seeing the constancy of Peter and of John, understanding that they were illiterate and ignorant men, they wondered; and they knew them that they had been with Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Seeing the man also who had been healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But they commanded them to go aside out of the council; and they conferred among themselves,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Saying: What shall we do to these men? for indeed a known miracle hath been done by them, to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem: it is manifest, and we cannot deny it.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But that it may be no farther spread among the people, let us threaten them that they speak no more in this name to any man.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And calling them, they charged them not to speak at all, nor teach in the name of Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But Peter and John answering, said to them: If it be just in the sight of God, to hear you rather than God, judge ye.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But they threatening, sent them away, not finding how they might punish them, because of the people; for all men glorified what had been done, in that which had come to pass.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For the man was above forty years old, in whom that miraculous cure had been wrought.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And being let go, they came to their own company, and related all that the chief priests and ancients had said to them.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Who having heard it, with one accord lifted up their voice to God, and said: Lord, thou art he that didst make heaven and earth, the sea, and all things that are in them.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Who, by the Holy Ghost, by the mouth of our father David, thy servant, hast said: Why did the Gentiles rage, and the people meditate vain things?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>The kings of the earth stood up, and the princes assembled together against the Lord and his Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For of a truth there assembled together in this city against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel,  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>To do what thy hand and thy counsel decreed to be done.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And now, Lord, behold their threatenings, and grant unto thy servants, that with all confidence they may speak thy word,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>By stretching forth thy hand to cures, and signs, and wonders to be done by the name of thy holy Son Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And when they had prayed, the place was moved wherein they were assembled; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spoke the word of God with confidence.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the multitude of believers had but one heart and one soul: neither did any one say that aught of the things which he possessed, was his own; but all things were common unto them.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And with great power did the apostles give testimony of the resurrection of Jesus Christ our Lord; and great grace was in them all.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>For neither was there any one needy among them. For as many as were owners of lands or houses, sold them, and brought the price of the things they sold,  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And laid it down before the feet of the apostles. And distribution was made to every one, according as he had need.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And Joseph, who, by the apostles, was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, by interpretation, The son of consolation,) a Levite, a Cyprian born,  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Having land, sold it, and brought the price, and laid it at the feet of the apostles. </div><ul class='tnav'>
