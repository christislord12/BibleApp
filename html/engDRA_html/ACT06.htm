And they chose Stephen, a man full of faith, and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte of Antioch.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>These they set before the apostles; and they praying, imposed hands upon them.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the word of the Lord increased; and the number of the disciples was multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly: a great multitude also of the priests obeyed the faith.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Stephen, full of grace and fortitude, did great wonders and signs among the people.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Now there arose some of that which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of them that were of Cilicia and Asia, disputing with Stephen.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit that spoke.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then they suborned men to say, they had heard him speak words of blasphemy against Moses and against God.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And they stirred up the people, and the ancients, and the scribes; and running together, they took him, and brought him to the council.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And they set up false witnesses, who said: This man ceaseth not to speak words against the holy place and the law.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the traditions which Moses delivered unto us.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And all that sat in the council, looking on him, saw his face as if it had been the face of an angel. </div><ul class='tnav'>
