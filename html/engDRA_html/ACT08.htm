<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 8</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And at that time there was raised a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all dispersed through the countries of Judea, and Samaria, except the apostles.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And devout men took order for Stephen’s funeral, and made great mourning over him.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>But Saul made havock of the church, entering in from house to house, and dragging away men and women, committed them to prison.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>They therefore that were dispersed, went about preaching the word of God.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And Philip going down to the city of Samaria, preached Christ unto them.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the people with one accord were attentive to those things which were said by Philip, hearing, and seeing the miracles which he did.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For many of them who had unclean spirits, crying with a loud voice, went out.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And many, taken with the palsy, and that were lame, were healed.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>There was therefore great joy in that city. Now there was a certain man named Simon, who before had been a magician in that city, seducing the people of Samaria, giving out that he was some great one:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>To whom they all gave ear, from the least to the greatest, saying: This man is the power of God, which is called great.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And they were attentive to him, because, for a long time, he had bewitched them with his magical practices.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But when they had believed Philip preaching of the kingdom of God, in the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then Simon himself believed also; and being baptized, he adhered to Philip. And being astonished, wondered to see the signs and exceeding great miracles which were done.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Now when the apostles, who were in Jerusalem, had heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Who, when they were come, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For he was not as yet come upon any of them; but they were only baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then they laid their hands upon them, and they received the Holy Ghost.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And when Simon saw, that by the imposition of the hands of the apostles, the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Saying: Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I shall lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost. But Peter said to him:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Keep thy money to thyself, to perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Thou hast no part nor lot in this matter. For thy heart is not right in the sight of God.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Do penance therefore for this thy wickedness; and pray to God, that perhaps this thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For I see thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bonds of iniquity.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then Simon answering, said: Pray you for me to the Lord, that none of these things which you have spoken may come upon me.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And they indeed having testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel to many countries of the Samaritans.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying: Arise, go towards the south, to the way that goeth down from Jerusalem into Gaza: this is desert.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And rising up, he went. And behold a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch, of great authority under Candace the queen of the Ethiopians, who had charge over all her treasures, had come to Jerusalem to adore.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And he was returning, sitting in this chariot, and reading Isaias the prophet.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And the Spirit said to Philip: Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Philip running thither, heard him reading the prophet Isaias. And he said: Thinkest thou that thou understandest what thou readest?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Who said: And how can I, unless some man shew me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the place of the scripture which he was reading was this: He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb without voice before his shearer, so openeth he not his mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>In humility his judgment was taken away. His generation who shall declare, for his life shall be taken from the earth?  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And the eunuch answering Philip, said: I beseech thee, of whom doth the prophet speak this? of himself, or of some other man?  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Then Philip, opening his mouth, and beginning at this scripture, preached unto him Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And as they went on their way, they came to a certain water; and the eunuch said: See, here is water: what doth hinder me from being baptized?  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And Philip said: If thou believest with all thy heart, thou mayest. And he answering, said: I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And he commanded the chariot to stand still; and they went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch: and he baptized him.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord took away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more. And he went on his way rejoicing.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>But Philip was found in Azotus; and passing through, he preached the gospel to all the cities, till he came to Caesarea. </div><ul class='tnav'>
