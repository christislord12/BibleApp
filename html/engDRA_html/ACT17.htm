<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 17</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And Paul, according to his custom, went in unto them; and for three sabbath days he reasoned with them out of the scriptures:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Declaring and insinuating that the Christ was to suffer, and to rise again from the dead; and that this is Jesus Christ, whom I preach to you.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And some of them believed, and were associated to Paul and Silas; and of those that served God, and of the Gentiles a great multitude, and of noble women not a few.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But the Jews, moved with envy, and taking unto them some wicked men of the vulgar sort, and making a tumult, set the city in an uproar; and besetting Jason’s house, sought to bring them out unto the people.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And not finding them, they drew Jason and certain brethren to the rulers of the city, crying: They that set the city in an uproar, are come hither also;  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Whom Jason hath received; and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And they stirred up the people, and the rulers of the city hearing these things,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And having taken satisfaction of Jason and of the rest, they let them go.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea. Who, when they were come thither, went into the synagogue of the Jews.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, who received the word with all eagerness, daily searching the scriptures, whether these things were so.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And many indeed of them believed, and of honourable women that were Gentiles, and of men not a few.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was also preached by Paul at Berea, they came thither also, stirring up and troubling the multitude.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul, to go unto the sea; but Silas and Timothy remained there.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And they that conducted Paul, brought him as far as Athens; and receiving a commandment from him to Silas and Timothy, that they should come to him with all speed, they departed.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Now whilst Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred within him, seeing the city wholly given to idolatry.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He disputed, therefore, in the synagogue with the Jews, and with them that served God, and in the marketplace, every day with them that were there.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And certain philosophers of the Epicureans and of the Stoics disputed with him; and some said: What is it, that this word sower would say? But others: He seemeth to be a setter forth of new gods; because he preached to them Jesus and the resurrection.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And taking him, they brought him to the Areopagus, saying: May we know what this new doctrine is, which thou speakest of?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For thou bringest in certain new things to our ears. We would know therefore what these things mean.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>(Now all the Athenians, and strangers that were there, employed themselves in nothing else, but either in telling or in hearing some new thing.)  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But Paul standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said: Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are too superstitious.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For passing by, and seeing your idols, I found an altar also, on which was written: To the unknown God. What therefore you worship, without knowing it, that I preach to you:  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>God, who made the world, and all things therein; he, being Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Neither is he served with men’s hands, as though he needed any thing; seeing it is he who giveth to all life, and breath, and all things:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And hath made of one, all mankind, to dwell upon the whole face of the earth, determining appointed times, and the limits of their habitation.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>That they should seek God, if happily they may feel after him or find him, although he be not far from every one of us:  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For in him we live, and move, and are; as some also of your own poets said: For we are also his offspring.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Being therefore the offspring of God, we must not suppose the divinity to be like unto gold, or silver, or stone, the graving of art, and device of man.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And God indeed having winked at the times of this ignorance, now declareth unto men, that all should every where do penance.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Because he hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the world in equity, by the man whom he hath appointed; giving faith to all, by raising him up from the dead.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And when they had heard of the resurrection of the dead, some indeed mocked, but others said: We will hear thee again concerning this matter.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>So Paul went out from among them.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But certain men adhering to him, did believe; among whom was also Dionysius, the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
