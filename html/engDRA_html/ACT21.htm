And entering into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we abode with him.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he had four daughters, virgins, who did prophesy.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And as we tarried there for some days, there came from Judea a certain prophet, named Agabus.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Who, when he was come to us, took Paul’s girdle: and binding his own feet and hands, he said: Thus saith the Holy Ghost: The man whose girdle this is, the Jews shall bind in this manner in Jerusalem, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Which when we had heard, both we and they that were of that place, desired him that he would not go up to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then Paul answered, and said: What do you mean weeping and afflicting my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but to die also in Jerusalem, for the name of the Lord Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And when we could not persuade him, we ceased, saying: The will of the Lord be done.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And after those days, being prepared, we went up to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And there went also with us some of the disciples from Caesarea, bringing with them one Mnason a Cyprian, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the day following, Paul went in with us unto James; and all the ancients were assembled.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Whom when he had saluted, he related particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But they hearing it, glorified God, and said to him: Thou seest, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews that have believed: and they are all zealous for the law.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Now they have heard of thee that thou teachest those Jews, who are among the Gentiles, to depart from Moses: saying, that they ought not to circumcise their children, nor walk according to the custom.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Do therefore this that we say to thee. We have four men, who have a vow on them.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Take these, and sanctify thyself with them: and bestow on them, that they may shave their heads: and all will know that the things which they have heard of thee, are false; but that thou thyself also walkest keeping the law.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But as touching the Gentiles that believe, we have written, decreeing that they should only refrain themselves from that which has been offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangles, and from fornication.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then Paul took the men, and the next day being purified with them, entered into the temple, giving notice of the accomplishment of the days of purification, until an oblation should be offered for every one of them.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But when the seven days were drawing to an end, those Jews that were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands upon him, crying out:  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Men of Israel, help: This is the man that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place; and moreover hath brought in Gentiles into the temple, and hath violated this holy place.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>(For they had seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And the whole city was in an uproar: and the people ran together. And taking Paul, they drew him out of the temple, and immediately the doors were shut.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And as they went about to kill him, it was told the tribune of the band, That all Jerusalem was in confusion.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Who, forthwith taking with him soldiers and centurions, ran down to them. And when they saw the tribune and the soldiers they left off beating Paul.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Then the tribune coming near, took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains: and demanded who he was, and what he had done.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude. And when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And when he was come to the stairs, it fell out that he was carried by the soldiers, because of the violence of the people.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>For the multitude of the people followed after, crying: Away with him.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And as Paul was about to be brought into the castle, he saith to the tribune: May speak something to thee? Who said: Canst thou speak Greek?  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Art not thou that Egyptian who before these days didst raise a tumult, and didst lead forth into the desert four thousand men that were murderers?  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>But Paul said to him: I am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city. And I beseech thee, suffer me to speak to the people.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And when he had given him leave, Paul standing on the stairs, beckoned with his hand to the people. And a great silence being made, he spoke unto them in the Hebrew tongue, saying: </div><ul class='tnav'>
