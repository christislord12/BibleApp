<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 24</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And after five days the high priest Ananias came down, with some of the ancients, and one Tertullus an orator, who went to the governor against Paul.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And Paul being called for, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying: Whereas through thee we live in much peace, and many things are rectified by thy providence,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>We accept it always and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thanksgiving.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But that I be no further tedious to thee, I desire thee of thy clemency to hear us in few words.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>We have found this to be a pestilent man, and raising seditions among all the Jews throughout the world, and author of the sedition of the sect of the Nazarenes.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom, we having apprehended, would also have judged according to our law.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But Lysias the tribune coming upon us, with great violence took him away out of our hands;  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Commanding his accusers to come to thee: of whom thou mayest thyself, by examination, have knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the Jews also added, and said that these things were so.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then Paul answered, (the governor making a sign to him to speak:) Knowing that for many years thou hast been judge over this nation, I will with good courage answer for myself.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days, since I went up to adore in Jerusalem:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And neither in the temple did they find me disputing with any man, or causing any concourse of the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Neither can they prove unto thee the things whereof they now accuse me.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But this I confess to thee, that according to the way, which they call a heresy, so do I serve the Father and my God, believing all things which are written in the law and the prophets:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Having hope in God, which these also themselves look for, that there shall be a resurrection of the just and unjust.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And herein do I endeavour to have always a conscience without offence toward God, and towards men.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Now after many years, I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings, and vows.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>In which I was found purified in the temple: neither with multitude, nor with tumult.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But certain Jews of Asia, who ought to be present before thee, and to accuse, if they had any thing against me:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Or let these men themselves say, if they found in me any iniquity, when standing before the council,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Except it be for this one voice only that I cried, standing among them, Concerning the resurrection of the dead am I judged this day by you.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Felix put them off, having most certain knowledge of this way, saying: When Lysias the tribune shall come down, I will hear you.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he commanded a centurion to keep him, and that he should be easy, and that he should not prohibit any of his friends to minister unto him.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And after some days, Felix, coming with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jew, sent for Paul, and heard of him the faith, that is in Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And as he treated of justice, and chastity, and of the judgment to come, Felix being terrified, answered: For this time, go thy way: but when I have a convenient time, I will send for thee.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Hoping also withal, that money should be given him by Paul; for which cause also oftentimes sending for him, he spoke with him.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But when two years were ended, Felix had for successor Portius Festus. And Felix being willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound. </div><ul class='tnav'>
