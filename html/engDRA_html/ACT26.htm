<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 26</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then Agrippa said to Paul: Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretching forth his hand, began to make his answer.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I think myself happy, O king Agrippa, that I am to answer for myself this day before thee, touching all the things whereof I am accused by the Jews.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Especially as thou knowest all, both customs and questions that are among the Jews: Wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And my life indeed from my youth, which was from the beginning among my own nation in Jerusalem, all the Jews do know:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Having known me from the beginning (if they will give testimony) that according to the most sure sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And now for the hope of the promise that was made by God to the fathers, do I stand subject to judgment:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Unto which, our twelve tribes, serving night and day, hope to come. For which hope, O king, I am accused by the Jews.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Why should it be thought a thing incredible, that God should raise the dead?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And I indeed did formerly think, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Which also I did at Jerusalem, and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority of the chief priests: and when they were put to death, I brought the sentence.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And oftentimes punishing them, in every synagogue, I compelled them to blaspheme: and being yet more mad against them, I persecuted them even unto foreign cities.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Whereupon when I was going to Damascus with authority and permission of the chief priest,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me, and them that were in company with me.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And when we were all fallen down on the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me in the Hebrew tongue: Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kick against the goad.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And I said: Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord answered: I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But rise up, and stand upon thy feet: for to this end have I appeared to thee, that I may make thee a minister, and a witness of those things which thou hast seen, and of those things wherein I will appear to thee,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Delivering thee from the people, and from the nations, unto which now I send thee:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>To open their eyes, that they may be converted from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and a lot among the saints, by the faith that is in me.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not incredulous to the heavenly vision:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But to them first that are at Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and unto all the country of Judea, and to the Gentiles did I preach, that they should do penance, and turn to God, doing works worthy of penance.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For this cause the Jews, when I was in the temple, having apprehended me, went about to kill me.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But being aided by the help of God, I stand unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying no other thing than those which the prophets, and Moses did say should come to pass:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light to the people, and to the Gentiles.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>As he spoke these things, and made his answer, Festus said with a loud voice: Paul, thou art beside thyself: much learning doth make thee mad.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Paul said: I am not mad, most excellent Festus, but I speak words of truth and soberness.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For the king knoweth of these things, to whom also I speak with confidence. For I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him. For neither was any of these things done in a corner.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Believest thou the prophets, O king Agrippa? I know that thou believest.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Agrippa said to Paul: In a little thou persuadest me to become a Christian.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Paul said: I would to God, that both in a little and in much, not only thou, but also all that hear me, this day, should become such as I also am, except these bands.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And when they were gone aside, they spoke among themselves, saying: This man hath done nothing worthy of death or of bands.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And Agrippa said to Festus: This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed to Caesar. </div><ul class='tnav'>
