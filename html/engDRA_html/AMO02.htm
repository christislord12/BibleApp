Is it not so, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And you will present wine to the Nazarites: and command the prophets, saying: Prophesy not.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Behold, I will screak under you as a wain screaketh that is laden with hay.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And flight shall perish from the swift, and the valiant shall not possess his strength, neither shall the strong save his life.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he that holdeth the bow shall not stand, and the swift of foot shall not escape, neither shall the rider of the horse save his life.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the stout of heart among the valiant shall flee away naked in that day, saith the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
