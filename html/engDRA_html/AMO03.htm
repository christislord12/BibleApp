Shall the snare be taken up from the earth, before it hath taken somewhat?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Shall the trumpet sound in a city, and the people not be afraid? Shall there be evil in a city, which the Lord hath not done?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For the Lord God doth nothing without revealing his secret to his servants the prophets.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The lion shall roar, who will not fear? The Lord God hath spoken, who shall not prophesy?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Publish it in the houses of Azotus, and in the houses of the land of Egypt, and say: Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold the many follies in the midst thereof, and them that suffer oppression in the inner rooms thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And they have not known to do the right thing, saith the Lord, storing up iniquity, and robberies in their houses.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord God: The land shall be in tribulation, and shall be compassed about: and thy strength shall be taken away from thee, and thy houses shall be spoiled.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord: As if a shepherd should get out of the lion’s mouth two legs, or the tip of the ear: so shall the children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria, in a piece of a bed, and in the couch of Damascus.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Hear ye, and testify in the house of Jacob, saith the Lord the God of hosts:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>That in the day when I shall begin to visit the transgressions of Israel, I will visit upon him, and upon the altars of Bethel: and the horns of the altars shall be cut off, and shall fall to the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And I will strike the winter house with the summer house: and the houses of ivory shall perish, and many houses shall be destroyed, saith the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
