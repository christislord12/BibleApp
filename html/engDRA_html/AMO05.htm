The house of Israel is fallen, and it shall rise no more.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The virgin of Israel is cast down upon her land, there is none to raise her up.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For thus saith the Lord God: The city, out of which came forth a thousand, there shall be left in it a hundred: and out of which there came a hundred, there shall be left in it ten, in the house of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For thus saith the Lord to the house of Israel: Seek ye me, and you shall live.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But seek not Bethel, and go not into Galgal, neither shall you pass over to Bersabee: for Galgal shall go into captivity, and Bethel shall be unprofitable.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Seek ye the Lord, and live: lest the house of Joseph be burnt with fire, and it shall devour, and there shall be none to quench Bethel.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>You that turn judgment into wormwood, and forsake justice in the land,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Seek him that maketh Arcturus, and Orion, and that turneth darkness into morning, and that changeth day into night: that calleth the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The Lord is his name.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>He that with a smile bringeth destruction upon the strong, and waste upon the mighty.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They have hated him that rebuketh in the gate: and have abhorred him that speaketh perfectly.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Therefore because you robbed the poor, and took the choice prey from him: you shall build houses with square stone, and shall not dwell in them: you shall plant most delightful vineyards, and shall not drink the wine of them.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Because I know your manifold crimes, and your grievous sins: enemies of the just, taking bribes, and oppressing the poor in the gate.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Therefore the prudent shall keep silence at that time, for it is an evil time.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Seek ye good, and not evil, that you may live: and the Lord the God of hosts will be with you, as you have said.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Hate evil, and love good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be the Lord the God of hosts may have mercy on the remnant of Joseph.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord the God of hosts the sovereign Lord: In every street there shall be wailing: and in all places that are without, they shall say: Alas, alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skillful in lamentation to lament.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And in all vineyards there shall be wailing: because I will pass through in the midst of thee, saith the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Woe to them that desire the day of the Lord: to what end is it for you? the day of the Lord is darkness, and not light.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>As if a man should flee from the face of a lion, and a bear should meet him: or enter into the house, and lean with his hand upon the wall, and a serpent should bite him.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Shall not the day of the Lord be darkness, and not light: and obscurity, and no brightness in it?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>I hate, and have rejected your festivities: and I will not receive the odour of your assemblies.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And if you offer me holocausts, and your gifts, I will not receive them: neither will I regard the vows of your fat beasts.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Take away from me the tumult of thy songs: and I will not hear the canticles of thy harp.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But judgment shall be revealed as water, and justice as a mighty torrent.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Did you offer victims and sacrifices to me in the desert for forty years, O house of Israel?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But you carried a tabernacle for your Moloch, and the image of your idols, the star of your god, which you made to yourselves.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And I will cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the Lord, the God of hosts is his name. </div><ul class='tnav'>
