And he shall any to him: Hold thy peace, and mention not the name of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For behold the Lord hath commanded, and he will strike the greater house with breaches, and the lesser house with clefts.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Can horses run upon the rocks, or can any one plough with buffles? for you have turned judgment into bitterness, and the fruit of justice into wormwood.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>You that rejoice in a thing of nought: you that say: Have we not taken unto us horns by our own strength?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But behold, I will raise up a nation against you, O house of Israel, saith the Lord the God of hosts; and they shall destroy you from the entrance of Emath, even to the torrent of the desert. </div><ul class='tnav'>
