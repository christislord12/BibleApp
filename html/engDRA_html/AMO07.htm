Yea this also shall not be, said the Lord God.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>These things the Lord shewed to me: and behold the Lord was standing upon a plastered wall, and in his hand a mason’s trowel.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the Lord said to me: What seest thou, Amos? And I said: A mason’s trowel. And the Lord said: Behold, I will lay down the trowel in the midst of my people Israel. I will plaster them over no more.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the high places of the idol shall be thrown down, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste: and I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Amasias the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying: Amos hath rebelled against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For thus saith Amos: Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall be carried away captive out of their own land.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Amasias said to Amos: Thou seer, go, flee away into the land of Juda: and eat bread there, and prophesy there.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But prophesy not again any more in Bethel: because it is the king’s sanctuary, and it is the house of the kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Amos answered and said to Amasias: I am not a prophet, nor am I the son of a prophet: but I am a herdsman plucking wild figs.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the Lord took me when I followed the flock, and the Lord said to me: Go, prophesy to my people Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And now hear thou the word of the Lord: Thou sayest, thou shalt not prophesy against Israel, and thou shalt not drop thy word upon the house of the idol.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord: Thy wife shall play the harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be measured by a line: and thou shalt die in a polluted land, and Israel shall go into captivity out of their land. </div><ul class='tnav'>
