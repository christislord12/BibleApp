And I said: A hook to draw down fruit. And the Lord said to me: The end is come upon my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And the hinges of the temple shall screak in that day, saith the Lord God: many shall die: silence shall be cast in every place.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Hear this, you that crush the poor, and make the needy of the land to fail,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Saying: When will the month be over, and we shall sell our wares: and the sabbath, and we shall open the corn: that we may lessen the measure, and increase the sicle, and may convey in deceitful balances,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>That we may possess the needy for money, and the poor for a pair of shoes, and may sell the refuse of the corn?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The Lord hath sworn against the pride of Jacob: surely I will never forget all their works.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein: and rise up altogether as a river, and be cast out, and run down as the river of Egypt?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord God, that the sun shall go down at midday, and I will make the earth dark in the day of light:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation: and I will bring up sackcloth upon every back of yours, and baldness upon every head: and I will make it as the mourning of an only son, and the latter end thereof as a bitter day.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I will send forth a famine into the land: not a famine of bread, nor a thirst of water, but of hearing the word of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And they shall move from sea to sea, and from the north to the east: they shall go about seeking the word of the Lord, and shall not find it.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>In that day the fair virgins, and the young men shall faint for thirst.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say: Thy God, O Dan, liveth: and the way of Bersabee liveth: and they shall fall, and shall rise no more. </div><ul class='tnav'>
