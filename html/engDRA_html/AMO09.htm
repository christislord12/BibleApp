And I will set my eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the Lord the God of hosts is he who toucheth the earth, and it shall melt: and all that dwell therein shall mourn: and it shall rise up as a river, and shall run down as the river of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>He that buildeth his ascension in heaven, and hath founded his bundle upon the earth: who calleth the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth, the Lord is his name.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Are not you as the children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel, saith the Lord? did not I bring up Israel, out of the land of Egypt: and the Philistines out of Cappadocia, and the Syrians out of Cyrene?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Behold the eyes of the Lord God are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from the face of the earth: but yet I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For behold I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, as corn is sifted in a sieve: and there shall not a little stone fall to the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>All the sinners of my people shall fall by the sword: who say: The evils shall not approach, and shall not come upon us.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>In that day I will raise up the tabernacle of David, that is fallen: and I will close up the breaches of the walls thereof, and repair what was fallen: and I will rebuild it as in the days of old.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and all nations, because my name is invoked upon them: saith the Lord that doth these things.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Behold the days come, saith the Lord, when the ploughman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed: and the mountains shall drop sweetness, and every hill shall be tilled.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And I will bring back the captivity of my people Israel: and they shall build the abandoned cities, and inhabit them: and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine of them: and shall make gardens, and eat the fruits of them. And I will plant them upon their own land: and I will no more pluck them out of their land which I have given them, saith the Lord thy God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
