And he hath taken the same out of the way, fastening it to the cross:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And despoiling the principalities and powers, he hath exposed them confidently in open shew, triumphing over them in himself.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink, or in respect of a festival day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbaths,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Which are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Let no man seduce you, willing in humility, and religion of angels, walking in the things which he hath not seen, in vain puffed up by the sense of his flesh,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And not holding the head, from which the whole body, by joints and bands, being supplied with nourishment and compacted, groweth unto the increase of God.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>If then you be dead with Christ from the elements of this world, why do you yet decree as though living in the world?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Touch not, taste not, handle not:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Which all are unto destruction by the very use, according to the precepts and doctrines of men.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in superstition and humility, and not sparing the body; not in any honour to the filling of the flesh. </div><ul class='tnav'>
