But Christ is all, and in all.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Put ye on therefore, as the elect of God, holy, and beloved, the bowels of mercy, benignity, humility, modesty, patience:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Bearing with one another, and forgiving one another, if any have a complaint against another: even as the Lord hath forgiven you, so do you also.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But above all these things have charity, which is the bond of perfection:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And let the peace of Christ rejoice in your hearts, wherein also you are called in one body: and be ye thankful.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Let the word of Christ dwell in you abundantly, in all wisdom: teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual canticles, singing in grace in your hearts to God.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>All whatsoever you do in word or in work, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Wives, be subject to your husbands, as it behoveth in the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter towards them.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing to the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Fathers, provoke not your children to indignation, lest they be discouraged.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh, not serving to the eye, as pleasing men, but in simplicity of heart, fearing God.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Whatsoever you do, do it from the heart, as to the Lord, and not to men:  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Knowing that you shall receive of the Lord the reward of inheritance. Serve ye the Lord Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For he that doth wrong, shall receive for that which he hath done wrongfully: and there is no respect of persons with God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
