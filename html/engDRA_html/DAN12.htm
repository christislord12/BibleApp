And at that time shall thy people be saved, every one that shall be found written in the book.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And many of those that sleep in the dust of the earth, shall awake: some unto life everlasting, and others unto reproach, to see it always.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>But they that are learned shall shine as the brightness of the firmament: and they that instruct many to justice, as stars for all eternity.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time appointed: many shall pass over, and knowledge shall be manifold.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And I Daniel looked, and behold as it were two others stood: one on this side upon the bank of the river, and another on that side, on the other bank of the river.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And I said to the man that was clothed In linen, that stood upon the waters of the river: How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And I heard the man that was clothed in linen, that stood upon the waters of the river: when he had lifted up his right hand, and his left hand to heaven, and had sworn, by him that liveth for ever, that it should be unto a time, and times, and half a time. And when the scattering of the band of the holy people shall be accomplished, all these things shall be finished.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And I heard, and understood not. And I said: O my lord, what shall be after these things?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he said: Go, Daniel, because the words are shut up, and sealed until the appointed time.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Many shall be chosen, and made white, and shall be tried as fire: and the wicked shall deal wickedly, and none of the wicked shall understand, but the learned shall understand.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And from the time when the continual sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination unto desolation shall be set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred ninety days,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Blessed is he that waiteth and cometh unto a thousand three hundred thirty-five days.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But go thou thy ways until the time appointed: and thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot unto the end of the days. </div><ul class='tnav'>
