His bed of iron is shewn, which is in Rabbath of the children of Ammon, being nine cubits long, and four broad after the measure of the cubit of a man’s hand.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And we possessed the land at that time from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the torrent Amen, unto the half of mount Galaad: and I gave the cities thereof to Ruben and Gad.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And I delivered the other part of Galaad, and all Basan the kingdom of Og to the half tribe of Manasses, all the country of Argob: and all Basan is called the Land of giants.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Jair the son of Manasses possessed all the country of Argob unto the borders of Gessuri, and Machati. And he called Basan by his own name, Havoth Jair, that is to say, the towns of Jair, until this present day.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>To Machir also I gave Galaad.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And to the tribes of Ruben and Gad I gave of the land of Galaad as far as the torrent Amen, half the torrent, and the confines even unto the torrent Jeboc, which is the border of the children of Ammon:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the plain of the wilderness, and the Jordan, and the borders of Cenereth unto the sea of the desert, which is the most salt sea, to the foot of mount Phasga eastward.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And I commanded you at that time, saying: The Lord your God giveth you this land for an inheritance, go ye well appointed before your brethren the children of Israel, all the strong men of you,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Leaving your wives and children and cattle. For I know you have much cattle, and they must remain in the cities, which I have delivered to you.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Until the Lord give rest to your brethren, as he hath given to you: and they also possess the land, which he will give them beyond the Jordan: then shall every man return to his possession, which I have given you.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>I commanded Josue also at that time, saying: Thy eyes have seen what the Lord your God hath done to these two kings: so will he do to all the kingdoms to which thou shalt pass.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Fear them not: for the Lord your God will fight for you.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And I besought the Lord at that time, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Lord God, thou hast begun to shew unto thy servant thy greatness, and most mighty hand, for there is no other God either in heaven or earth, that is able to do thy works, or to be compared to thy strength.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>I will pass over therefore, and will see this excellent land beyond the Jordan, and this goodly mountain, and Libanus.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the Lord was angry with me on your account and heard me not, but said to me: It is enough: speak no more to me of this matter.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Go up to the top of Phasga, and cast thy eyes round about to the west, and to the north, and to the south, and to the east, and behold it, for thou shalt not pass this Jordan.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Command Josue, and encourage and strengthen him: for he shall go before this people, and shall divide unto them the land which thou shalt see.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And we abode in the valley over against the temple of Phogor. </div><ul class='tnav'>
