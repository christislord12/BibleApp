And after he had afflicted and proved thee, at the last he had mercy on thee,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Lest thou shouldst say in thy heart: My own might, and the strength of my own hand have achieved all these things for me.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But remember the Lord thy God, that he hath given thee strength, that he might fulfill his covenant, concerning which he swore to thy fathers, as this present day sheweth.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But if thou forget the Lord thy God, and follow strange gods, and serve and adore them: behold now I foretell thee that thou shalt utterly perish.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>As the nations, which the Lord destroyed at thy entrance, so shall you also perish, if you be disobedient to the voice of the Lord your God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
