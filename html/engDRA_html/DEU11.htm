From the desert, and from Libanus, from the great river Euphrates unto the western sea shall be your borders.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>None shall stand against you: the Lord your God shall lay the dread and fear of you upon all the land that you shall tread upon, as he hath spoken to you.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Behold I set forth in your sight this day a blessing and a curse:  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>A blessing, if you obey the commandments of the Lord your God, which I command you this day:  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>A curse, if you obey not the commandments of the Lord your. God, but revolt from the way which now I shew you, and walk after strange gods which you know not.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land, whither thou goest to dwell, thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Garizim, the curse upon mount Hebal:  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Which are beyond the Jordan, behind the way that goeth to the setting of the sun, in the land of the Chanaanite who dwelleth in the plain country over against Galgala, which is near the valley that reacheth and entereth far.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For you shall pass over the Jordan, to possess the land, which the Lord your God will give you, that you may have it and possess it.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>See therefore that you fulfill the ceremonies and judgments, which I shall set this day before you. </div><ul class='tnav'>
