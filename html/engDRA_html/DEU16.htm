No one shall appear with his hands empty before the Lord:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But every one shall offer according to what he hath, according to the blessing of the Lord his God, which he shall give him.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Thou shalt appoint judges and magistrates in all thy gates, which the Lord thy God shall give thee, in all thy tribes: that they may judge the people with just judgment,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And not go aside to either part. Thou shalt not accept person nor gifts: for gifts blind the eyes of the wise, and change the words of the just.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Thou shalt follow justly after that which is just: that thou mayst live and possess the land, which the Lord thy God shall give thee.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Thou shalt plant no grove, nor any tree near the altar of the Lord thy God:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Neither shalt thou make nor set up to thyself a statue: which things the Lord thy God hateth. </div><ul class='tnav'>
