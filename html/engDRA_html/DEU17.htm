Let no man be put to death, when only one beareth witness against him.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to kill him, and afterwards the hands of the rest of the people: that thou mayst take away the evil out of the midst of thee.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>If thou perceive that there be among you a hard and doubtful matter in judgment between blood and blood, cause and cause, leprosy and leprosy: and thou see that the words of the judges within thy gates do vary: arise, and go up to the place, which the Lord thy God shall choose.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And thou shalt come to the priests of the Levitical race, and to the judge, that shall be at that time: and thou shalt ask of them, and they shall shew thee the truth of the judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And thou shalt do whatsoever they shall say, that preside in the place, which the Lord shall choose, and what they shall teach thee,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>According to his law; and thou shalt follow their sentence: neither shalt thou decline to the right hand nor to the left hand.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But he that will be proud, and refuse to obey the commandment of the priest, who ministereth at that time to the Lord thy God, and the decree of the judge, that man shall die, and thou shalt take away the evil from Israel:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And all the people hearing it shall fear, that no one afterwards swell with pride.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>When thou art come into the land, which the Lord thy God will give thee, and possessest it, and shalt say: I will set a king over me, as all nations have that are round about:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Thou shalt set him whom the Lord thy God shall choose out of the number of thy brethren. Thou mayst not make a man of another nation king, that is not thy brother.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And when he is made king, he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor lead back the people into Egypt, being lifted up with the number of his horsemen, especially since the Lord hath commanded you to return no more the same way.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He shall not have many wives, that may allure his mind, nor immense sums of silver and gold.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But after he is raised to the throne of his kingdom, he shall copy out to himself the Deuteronomy of this law in a volume, taking the copy of the priests of the Levitical tribe,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he shall have it with him, and shall read it all the days of his life, that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, and keep his words and ceremonies, that are commanded in the law;  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And that his heart be not lifted up with pride over his brethren, nor decline to the right or to the left, that he and his sons may reign a long time over Israel. </div><ul class='tnav'>
