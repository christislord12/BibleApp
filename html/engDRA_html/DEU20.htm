And thou shalt divide all the prey to the army, and thou shalt eat the spoils of thy enemies, which the Lord thy God shall give thee.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So shalt thou do to all cities that are at a great distance from thee, and are not of these cities which thou shalt receive in possession.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But of those cities that shall be given thee, thou shalt suffer none at all to live:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But shalt kill them with the edge of the sword, to wit, the Hethite, and the Amorrhite, and the Chanaanite, the Pherezite, and the Hevite, and the Jebusite, as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Lest they teach you to do all the abominations which they have done to their gods: and you should sin against the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>When thou hast besieged a city a long time, and hath compassed it with bulwarks to take it, thou shalt not cut down the trees that may be eaten of, neither shalt thou spoil the country round about with axes: for it is a tree, and not a man, neither can it increase the number of them that fight against thee.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But if there be any trees that are not fruitful, but wild, and fit for other uses, cut them down, and make engines, until thou take the city, which fighteth against thee. </div><ul class='tnav'>
