And they shall spread the cloth before the ancients of the city:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the ancients of that city shall take that man, and beat him,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Condemning him besides in a hundred sides of silver, which he shall give to the damsel’s father, because he hath defamed by a very ill name a virgin of Israel: and he shall have her to wife, and may not put her away all the days of his life.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But if what he charged her with be true, and virginity be not found in the damsel:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>They shall cast her out of the doors of her father’s house, and the men of the city shall stone her to death, and she shall die: because she hath done a wicked thing in Israel, to play the whore in her father’s house: and thou shalt take away the evil out of the midst of thee.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>If a man lie with another man’s wife, they shall both die, that is to say, the adulterer and the adulteress: and thou shalt take away the evil out of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>If a man have espoused a damsel that is a virgin, and some one find her in the city, and lie with her,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Thou shalt bring them both out to the gate of that city, and they shall be stoned: the damsel, because she cried not out, being in the city: the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour’s wife. And thou shalt take away the evil from the midst of thee.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But if a man find a damsel that is betrothed, in the field, and taking hold of her, lie with her, he alone shall die:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>The damsel shall suffer nothing, neither is she guilty of death: for as a robber riseth against his brother, and taketh away his life, so also did the damsel suffer:  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>She was alone in the field: she cried, and there was no man to help her.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, who is not espoused, and taking her, lie with her, and the matter come to judgment:  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>He that lay with her shall give to the father of the maid fifty sides of silver, and shall have her to wife, because he hath humbled her: he may not put her away all the days of his life.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>No man shall take his father’s wife, nor remove his covering. </div><ul class='tnav'>
