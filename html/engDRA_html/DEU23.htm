And when thou sittest down, thou shalt dig round about, and with the earth that is dug up thou shalt cover  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>That which thou art eased of: (for the Lord thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver thee, and to give up thy enemies to thee:) and let thy camp be holy, and let no uncleanness appear therein, lest he go away from thee.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Thou shalt not deliver to his master the servant that is fled to thee.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He shall dwell with thee ill the place that shall please him, and shall rest, in one of thy cities: give him no trouble.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>There shall be no whore among the daughters of Israel, nor whoremonger among the sons of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Thou shalt not offer the hire of a strumpet, nor the price of a dog, in the house of the Lord thy God, whatsoever it be that thou hast vowed: because both these are an abomination to the Lord thy God.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Thou shalt not lend to thy brother money to usury, nor corn, nor any other thing:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But to the stranger. To thy brother thou shalt lend that which he wanteth, without usury: that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all thy works in the land, which thou shalt go in to possess.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>When thou hast made a vow to the Lord thy God, thou shalt not delay to pay it: because the Lord thy God will require it. And if thou delay, it shall be imputed to thee for a sin.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>If thou wilt not promise, thou shalt be without sin.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But that which is once gone out of thy lips, thou shalt observe, and shalt do as thou hast promised to the Lord thy God, and hast spoken with thy own will and with thy own mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Going into thy neighbour’s vineyard, thou mayst eat as many grapes as thou pleasest: but must carry none out with thee:  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>If thou go into thy friend’s corn, thou mayst break the ears, and rub them in thy hand: but not reap them with a sickle. </div><ul class='tnav'>
