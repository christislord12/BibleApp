And we slew them.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And took their land, and delivered it for a possession to Ruben and Gad, and the half tribe of Manasses.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and fulfill them: that you may understand all that you do.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>You all stand this day before the Lord your God, your princes, and tribes, and ancients, and doctors, all the people of Israel,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Your children and your wives, and the stranger that abideth with thee in the camp, besides the hewers of wood, and them that bring water:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>That thou mayst pass in the covenant of the Lord thy God, and in the oath which this day the Lord thy God maketh with thee.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>That he may raise thee up a people to himself, and he may be thy God as he hath spoken to thee, and as he swore to thy fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Neither with you only do I make this covenant, and confirm these oaths,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But with all that are present and that are absent.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For you know how we dwelt in the land of Egypt, and how we have passed through the midst of nations, and passing through them,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>You have seen their abominations and filth, that is to say, their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which they worshipped.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Lest perhaps there should be among you a man or a woman, a family or a tribe, whose heart is turned away this day from the Lord our God, to go and serve the gods of those nations: and there should be among you a root bringing forth gall and bitterness.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And when he shall hear the words of this oath, he should bless himself in his heart saying: I shall have peace, and will walk on in the naughtiness of my heart: and the drunken may consume the thirsty,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the Lord should not forgive him: but his wrath and jealousy against that man should be exceedingly enkindled at that time, and all the curses that are written in this volume should light upon him: and the Lord should blot out his name from under heaven,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And utterly destroy him out of all the tribes of Israel, according to the curses that are contained in the book of this law and covenant:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the following generation shall say, and the children that shall be born hereafter, and the strangers that shall come from afar, seeing the plagues of that land and the evils wherewith the Lord hath afflicted it,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Burning it with brimstone, and the heat of salt, so that it cannot be sown any more, nor any green thing grow therein, after the example of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrha, Adama and Seboim, which the Lord destroyed in his wrath and indignation:  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And all the nations shall say: Why hath the Lord done thus to this land? what meaneth this exceeding great heat of his wrath?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And they shall answer: Because they forsook the covenant of the Lord, which he made with their fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And they have served strange gods, and adored them, whom they knew not, and for whom they had not been assigned:  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Therefore the wrath of the Lord was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this volume:  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And he hath cast them out of their land, in anger and in wrath, and in very great indignation, and hath thrown them into a strange land, as it is seen this day.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Secret things to the Lord our God: things that are manifest, to us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law. </div><ul class='tnav'>
