For the Lord will return to rejoice over thee in all good things, as he rejoiced in thy fathers:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Yet so if thou hear the voice of the Lord thy God, and keep his precepts and ceremonies, which are written in this law: and return to the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>This commandment, that I command thee this day is not above thee, nor far off from thee:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Nor is it in heaven, that thou shouldst say: Which of us can go up to heaven to bring it unto us, and we may hear and fulfill it in work?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Nor is it beyond the sea: that thou mayst excuse thyself, and say: Which of us can cross the sea, and bring it unto us: that we may hear, and do that which is commanded?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart, that thou mayst do it.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Consider that I have set before thee this day life and good, and on the other hand death and evil:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>That thou mayst love the Lord thy God, and walk in his ways, and keep his commandments and ceremonies and judgments, and thou mayst live, and he may multiply thee, and bless thee in the land, which thou shalt go in to possess.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But if thy heart be turned away, so that thou wilt not hear, and being deceived with error thou adore strange gods, and serve them:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I foretell thee this day that thou shalt perish, and shalt remain but a short time in the land, to which thou shalt pass over the Jordan, and shalt go in to possess it.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>I call heaven and earth to witness this day, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing. Choose therefore life, that both thou and thy seed may live:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And that thou mayst love the Lord thy God, and obey his voice, and adhere to him (for he is thy life, and the length of thy days,) that thou mayst dwell in the land, for which the Lord swore to thy fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that he would give it them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
