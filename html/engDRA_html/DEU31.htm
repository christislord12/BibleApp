So Moses and Josue went and stood in the tabernacle of the testimony:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the Lord appeared there in the pillar of a cloud, which stood in the entry of the tabernacle.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Moses: Behold thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, and this people rising up will go a fornicating after strange gods in the land, to which it goeth in to dwell: there will they forsake me, and will make void the covenant, which I have made with them,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And my wrath shall be kindled against them in that day: and I will forsake them, and will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured: all evils and afflictions shall find them, so that they shall say in that day: In truth it is because God is not with me, that these evils have found me.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But I will hide, and cover my face in that day, for all the evils which they have done, because they have followed strange gods.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Now therefore write you this canticle, and teach the children of Israel: that they may know it by heart, and sing it by mouth, and this song may be unto me for a testimony among the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For I will bring them into the land, for which I swore to their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey. And when they have eaten, and are full and fat, they will turn away after strange gods, and will serve them: and will despise me, and make void my covenant.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And after many evils and afflictions shall have come upon them, this canticle shall answer them for a testimony, which no oblivion shall take away out of the mouth of their seed. For I know their thoughts, and what they are about to do this day, before that I bring them into the land which I have promised them.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Moses therefore wrote the canticle and taught it to the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the Lord commanded Josue the son of Nun, and said: Take courage, and be valiant: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I have promised, and I will be with thee.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Therefore after Moses had wrote the words of this law in a volume, and finished it:  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>He commanded the Levites, who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord. saying:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Take this book, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God: that it may be there for a testimony against thee.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For I know thy obstinacy, and thy most stiff neck, While I am yet living, and going in with you, you have always been rebellious against the Lord: how much more when I shall be dead?  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Gather unto me all the ancients of your tribes, and your doctors, and I will speak these words in their hearing, and will call heaven and earth to witness against them.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For I know that, after my death, you will do wickedly, and will quickly turn aside from the way that I have commanded you: and evils shall come upon you in the latter times, when you shall do evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him by the works of your hands.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Moses therefore spoke, in the hearing of the whole assembly of Israel, the words of this canticle, and finished it even to the end, </div><ul class='tnav'>
