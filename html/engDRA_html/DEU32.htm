Is not he thy father, that hath possessed thee, and made thee, and created thee?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Remember the days of old, think upon every generation: ask thy father, and he will declare to thee: thy elders and they will tell thee.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>When the Most High divided the nations: when he separated the sons of Adam, he appointed the bounds of people according to the number of the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But the Lord’s portion is his people: Jacob the lot of his inheritance.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He found him in a desert land, in a place of horror, and of vast wilderness: he led him about, and taught him: and he kept him as the apple of his eye.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>As the eagle enticing her young to fly, and hovering over them, he spread his wings, and hath taken him and carried him on his shoulders.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The Lord alone was his leader: and there was no strange god with him.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He set him upon high land: that he might eat the fruits of the fields, that he might suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the hardest stone,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Butter of the herd, and milk of the sheep with the fat of lambs, and of the rams of the breed of Basan: and goats with the marrow of wheat, and might drink the purest blood of the grape.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The beloved grew fat, and kicked: he grew fat, and thick and gross, he forsook God who made him, and departed from God his saviour.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>They provoked him by strange gods, and stirred him up to anger, with their abominations.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>They sacrificed to devils and not to God: to gods whom they knew not: that were newly come up, whom their fathers worshipped not.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Thou hast forsaken the God that beget thee, and hast forgotten the Lord that created thee.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The Lord saw, and was moved to wrath: because his own sons and daughters provoked him.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he said: I will hide my face from them, and will consider what their last end shall be: for it is a perverse generation, and unfaithful children.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>They have provoked me with that which was no god, and have angered me with their vanities: and I will provoke them with that which is no people, and will vex them with a foolish nation.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>A fire is kindled in my wrath, and shall burn even to the lowest hell: and shall devour the earth with her increase, and shall burn the foundations of the mountains.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>I will heap evils upon them, and will spend my arrows among them.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>They shall be consumed with famine, and birds shall devour them with a most bitter bite: I will send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the fury of creatures that trail upon the ground, and of serpents.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Without, the sword shall lay them waste, and terror within, both the young man and the virgin, the sucking child with the man in years.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>I said: Where are they? I will make the memory of them to cease from among men.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But for the wrath of the enemies I have deferred it: lest perhaps their enemies might be proud, and should say: Our mighty hand, and not the Lord, hath done all these things.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>They are a nation without counsel, and without wisdom.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>O that they would be wise and would understand, and would provide for their last end.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>How should one pursue after a thousand, and two chase ten thousand? Was it not, because their God had sold them, and the Lord had shut them up?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For our God is not as their gods: our enemies themselves are judges.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Their vines are of the vineyard of Sodom, and of the suburbs of Gomorrha: their grapes are grapes of gall, and their clusters most bitter.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Their wine is the gall of dragons, and the venom of asps, which is incurable.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Are not these things stored up with me, and sealed up in my treasures?  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Revenge is mine, and I will repay them in due time, that their foot may slide: the day of destruction is at hand, and the time makes haste to come.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>The Lord will judge his people, and will have mercy on his servants: he shall see that their hand is weakened, and that they who were shut up have also failed, and they that remained are consumed.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And he shall say: Where are their gods, in whom they trusted?  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Of whose victims they ate the fat, and drank the wine of their drink offerings: let them arise and help you, and protect you in your distress.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>See ye that I alone am, and there is no other God besides me: I will kill and I will make to live: I will strike, and I will heal, and there is none that can deliver out of my hand.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>I will lift up my hand to heaven, and I will say: I live for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>If I shall whet my sword as the lightning, and my hand take hold on judgment: I will render vengeance to my enemies, and repay them that hate me.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh, of the blood of the slain and of the captivity, of the bare head of the enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Praise his people, ye nations, for he will revenge the blood of his servants: and will render vengeance to their enemies, and he will be merciful to the land of his people.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>So Moses came and spoke all the words of this canticle in the ears of the people, and Josue the son of Nun.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And he ended all these words, speaking to all Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And he said to them: Set your hearts on all the words, which I testify to you this day: which you shall command your children to observe and to do, and to fulfill all that is written in this law:  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>For they are not commanded you in vain, but that every one should live in them, and that doing them you may continue a long time in the land whither you are going over the Jordan to possess it.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>And the Lord spoke to Moses the same day, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Go up into this mountain Abarim, (that is to say, of passages,) unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab over against Jericho: and see the land of Chanaan, which I will deliver to the children of Israel to possess, and die thou in the mountain.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>When thou art gone up into it thou shalt be gathered to thy people, as Aaron thy brother died in mount Her, and was gathered to his people:  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Because you trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel, at the waters of contradiction in Cades of the desert of Sin: and you did not sanctify me among the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>Thou shalt see the land before thee, which I will give to the children of Israel, but thou shalt not enter into it. </div><ul class='tnav'>
