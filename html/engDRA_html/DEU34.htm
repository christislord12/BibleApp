Thou hast seen it with thy eyes, and shalt not pass over to it.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And Moses the servant of the Lord died there, in the land of Moab, by the commandment of the Lord:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And he buried him in the valley of the land of Moab over against Phogor: and no man hath known of his sepulchre until this present day.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, neither were his teeth moved.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the children of Israel mourned for him in the plains of Moab thirty days: and the days of their mourning in which they mourned for Moses were ended.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Josue the son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom, because Moses had laid his hands upon him. And the children of Israel obeyed him, and did as the Lord commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And there arose no more a prophet in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>In all the signs and wonders, which he sent by him, to do in the land of Egypt to Pharao, and to all his servants, and to his whole land,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And all the mighty hand, and great miracles, which Moses did before all Israel. </div><ul class='tnav'>
