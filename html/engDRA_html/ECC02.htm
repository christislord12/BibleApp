And I saw that this also was vanity.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Laughter I counted error: and to mirth I said: Why art thou vainly deceived?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I thought in my heart, to withdraw my flesh from wine, that I might turn my mind to wisdom, and might avoid folly, till I might see what was profitable for the children of men: and what they ought to do under the sun, all the days of their life.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I made me great works, I built me houses, and planted vineyards,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>I made gardens, and orchards, and set them with trees of all kinds,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And I made me ponds of water, to water therewith the wood of the young trees,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I got me menservants, and maidservants, and had a great family: and herds of oxen, and great flocks of sheep, above all that were before me in Jerusalem:  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I heaped together for myself silver and gold, and the wealth of kings, and provinces: I made me singing men, and singing women, and the delights of the sons of men, cups and vessels to serve to pour out wine:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And I surpassed in riches all that were before me in Jerusalem: my wisdom also remained with me.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And whatsoever my eyes desired, I refused them not: and I withheld not my heart from enjoying every pleasure, and delighting itself in the things which I had prepared: and esteemed this my portion, to make use of my own labour.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And when I turned myself to all the works which my hands had wrought, and to the labours wherein I had laboured in vain, I saw in all things vanity, and vexation of mind, and that nothing was lasting under the sun.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I passed further to behold wisdom, and errors and folly, (What is man, said I, that he can follow the King his maker?)  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And I saw that wisdom excelled folly, as much as light differeth from darkness.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The eyes of a wise man are in his head: the fool walketh in darkness: and I learned that they were to die both alike.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And I said in my heart: If the death of the fool and mine shall be one, what doth it avail me, that I have applied myself more to the study of wisdom? And speaking with my own mind, I perceived that this also was vanity.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For there shall be no remembrance of the wise no more than of the fool for ever, and the times to come shall cover all things together with oblivion: the learned dieth in like manner as the unlearned.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And therefore I was weary of my life, when I saw that all things under the sun are evil, and all vanity and vexation of spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Again I hated all my application wherewith I had earnestly laboured under the sun, being like to have an heir after me,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Whom I know not whether he will be a wise man or a fool, and he shall have rule over all my labours with which I have laboured and been solicitous: and is there any thing so vain?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Wherefore I left off and my heart renounced labouring any more under the sun.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For when a man laboureth in wisdom, and knowledge, and carefulness, he leaveth what he hath gotten to an idle man: so this also is vanity, and a great evil.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For what profit shall a man have of all his labour, and vexation of spirit, with which he bath been tormented under the sun?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>All his days axe full of sorrows and miseries, even in the night he doth not rest in mind: and is not this vanity?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Is it not better to eat and drink, and to shew his soul good things of his labours? and this is from the hand of God.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Who shall so feast and abound with delights as I?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>God hath given to a man that is good in his sight, wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he hath given vexation, and superfluous care, to heap up and to gather together, and to give it to him that hath pleased God: but this also is vanity, and a fruitless solicitude of the mind. </div><ul class='tnav'>
