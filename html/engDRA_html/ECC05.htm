For God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Dreams follow many cares: and in many words shall be found folly.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>If thou hast vowed any thing to God, defer not to pay it: for an unfaithful and foolish promise displeaseth him: but whatsoever thou hast vowed, pay it.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And it is much better not to vow, than after a vow not to perform the things promised.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Give not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin: and say not before the angel: There is no providence: lest God be angry at thy words, and destroy all the works of thy hands.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Where there are many dreams, there are many vanities, and words without number: but do thou fear God.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>If thou shalt see the oppressions of the poor, and violent judgments, and justice perverted in the province, wonder not at this matter: for he that is high hath another higher, and there are others still higher than these:  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Moreover there is the king that reigneth over all the land subject to him.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>A covetous man shall not be satisfied with money: and he that loveth riches shall reap no fruit from them: so this also is vanity.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Where there are great riches, there are also many to eat them. And what doth it profit the owner, but that he seeth the riches with his eyes?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Sleep is sweet to a labouring man, whether he eat little or much: but the fulness of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>There is also another grievous evil, which I have seen under the sun: riches kept to the hurt of the owner.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For they are lost with very great affliction: he hath begotten a son, who shall be in extremity of want.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>As he came forth naked from his mother’s womb, so shall he return, and shall take nothing away with him of his labour.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>A most deplorable evil: as he came, so shall he return. What then doth it profit him that he hath laboured for the wind?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>All the days of his life he eateth in darkness, and in many cares, and in misery, and sorrow.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>This therefore hath seemed good to me, that a man should eat and drink, and enjoy the fruit of his labour, wherewith he hath laboured under the sun, all the days of his life, which God hath given him: and this is his portion.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And every man to whom God hath given riches, and substance, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to enjoy his portion, and to rejoice of his labour: this is the gift of God.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For he shall not much remember the days of his life, because God entertaineth his heart with delight, </div><ul class='tnav'>
