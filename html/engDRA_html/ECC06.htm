<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 6</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>There is also another evil, which I have seen under the sun, and that frequent among men:  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>A man to whom God hath given riches, and substance, and honour, and his soul wanteth nothing of all that he desireth: yet God doth not give him power to eat thereof, but a stranger shall eat it up. This is vanity and a great misery.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>If a man beget a hundred children, and live many years, and attain to a great age, and his soul make no use of the goods of his substance, and he be without burial: of this man I pronounce, that the untimely born is better than he.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For he came in vain, and goeth to darkness, and his name shall be wholly forgotten.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>He hath not seen the sun, nor known the distance of good and evil:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Although he lived two thousand years, and hath not enjoyed good things: do not all make haste to one place?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>All the labour of man is for his mouth, but his soul shall not be filled.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>What hath the wise man more than the fool? and what the poor man, but to go thither, where there is life?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Better it is to see what thou mayst desire, than to desire that which thou canst not know. But this also is vanity, and presumption of spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He that shall be, his name is already called: and it is known, that he is man, and cannot contend in judgment with him that is stronger than himself.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>There are many words that have much vanity in disputing. </div><ul class='tnav'>
