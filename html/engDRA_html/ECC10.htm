Wisdom and glory is more precious than a small and shortlived folly.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The heart of a wise man is in his right hand, and the heart of a fool is in his left hand.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Yea, and the fool when he walketh in the way, whereas be himself is a fool, esteemeth all men fools.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>If the spirit of him that hath power, ascend upon thee, leave not thy place: because care will make the greatest sins to cease.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, as it were by an error proceeding from the face of the prince:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>A fool set in high dignity, and the rich sitting beneath.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I have seen servants upon horses: and princes walking on the ground as servants.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>He that diggeth a pit, shall fall into it: and he that breaketh a hedge, a serpent shall bite him.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>He that removeth stones, shall be hurt by them: and he that cutteth trees, shall be wounded by them.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>If the iron be blunt, and be not as before, but be made blunt, with much labour it shall be sharpened: and after industry shall follow wisdom.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>If a serpent bite in silence, he is nothing better that backbiteth secretly.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The words of the mouth of a wise man are grace: but the lips of a fool shall throw him down headlong.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The beginning of his words is folly, and the end of his talk is a mischievous error.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>A fool multiplieth words. A man cannot tell what hath been before him: and what shall be after him, who can tell him?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The labour of fools shall afflict them that know not bow to go to the city.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and when the princes eat in the morning.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Blessed is the land, whose king is noble, and whose princes eat in due season for refreshment, and not for riotousness.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>By slothfulness a building shall be brought down, and through the weakness of hands, the house shall drop through.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For laughter they make bread, and wine that the living may feast: and all things obey money.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Detract not the king, no not in thy thought; and speak not evil of the rich man in thy private chamber: because even the birds of the air will carry thy voice, and he that hath wings will tell what thou hast said. </div><ul class='tnav'>
