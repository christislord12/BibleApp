Of making many books there is no end: and much study is an affliction of the flesh.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Let us all hear together the conclusion of the discourse. Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is all man:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And all things that are done, God will bring into judgment for every error, whether it be good or evil. </div><ul class='tnav'>
