Let not the sun go down upon your anger.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Give not place to the devil.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>He that stole, let him now steal no more; but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have something to give to him that suffereth need.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Let no evil speech proceed from your mouth; but that which is good, to the edification of faith, that it may administer grace to the hearers.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And grieve not the holy Spirit of God: whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Let all bitterness, and anger, and indignation, and clamour, and blasphemy, be put away from you, with all malice.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And be ye kind one to another; merciful, forgiving one another, even as God hath forgiven you in Christ. </div><ul class='tnav'>
