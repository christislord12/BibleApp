<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 5</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Be ye therefore followers of God, as most dear children;  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath delivered himself for us, an oblation and a sacrifice to God for an odour of sweetness.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not so much as be named among you, as becometh saints:  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Or obscenity, or foolish talking, or scurrility, which is to no purpose; but rather giving of thanks.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For know you this and understand, that no fornicator, or unclean, or covetous person (which is a serving of idols), hath inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Let no man deceive you with vain words. For because of these things cometh the anger of God upon the children of unbelief.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Be ye not therefore partakers with them.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For you were heretofore darkness, but now light in the Lord. Walk then as children of the light.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For the fruit of the light is in all goodness, and justice, and truth;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Proving what is well pleasing to God:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For the things that are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to speak of.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But all things that are reproved, are made manifest by the light; for all that is made manifest is light.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Wherefore he saith: Rise thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead: and Christ shall enlighten thee.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>See therefore, brethren, how you walk circumspectly: not as unwise,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But as wise: redeeming the time, because the days are evil.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Wherefore become not unwise, but understanding what is the will of God.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And be not drunk with wine, wherein is luxury; but be ye filled with the holy Spirit,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Speaking to yourselves in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual canticles, singing and making melody in your hearts to the Lord;  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Giving thanks always for all things, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God and the Father:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Being subject one to another, in the fear of Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Let women be subject to their husbands, as to the Lord:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Because the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the church. He is the saviour of his body.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Therefore as the church is subject to Christ, so also let the wives be to their husbands in all things.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Husbands, love your wives, as Christ also loved the church, and delivered himself up for it:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>That he might sanctify it, cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of life:  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any; such thing; but that it should be holy, and without blemish.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>So also ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife, loveth himself.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, as also Christ doth the church:  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Because we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they shall be two in one flesh.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>This is a great sacrament; but I speak in Christ and in the church.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Nevertheless let every one of you in particular love his wife as himself: and let the wife fear her husband. </div><ul class='tnav'>
