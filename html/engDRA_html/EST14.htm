Thou art just, O Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And now they are not content to oppress us with most hard bondage, but attributing the strength of their hands to the power of their idols,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>They design to change thy promises, and destroy thy inheritance, and shut the mouths of them that praise thee, and extinguish the glory of thy temple and altar,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>That they may open the mouths of Gentiles, and praise the strength of idols, and magnify for ever a carnal king.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Give not, O Lord, thy sceptre to them that are not, lest they laugh at our ruin: but turn their counsel upon themselves, and destroy him that hath begun to rage against us.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Remember, O Lord, and shew thyself to us in the time of our tribulation, and give me boldness, O Lord, king of gods, and of all power:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Give me a well ordered speech in my mouth in the presence of the lion, and turn his heart to the hatred of our enemy, that both he himself may perish, and the rest that consent to him.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But deliver us by thy hand, and help me, who have no other helper, but thee, O Lord, who hast the knowledge of all things.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And thou knowest that I hate the glory of the wicked, and abhor the bed of the uncircumcised, and of every stranger.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Thou knowest my necessity, that I abominate the sign of my pride and glory, which is upon my head in the days of my public appearance, and detest it as a menstruous rag, and wear it not in the days of my silence,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And that I have not eaten at Aman’s table, nor hath the king’s banquet pleased me, and that I have not drunk the wine of the drink offerings:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And that thy handmaid hath never rejoiced, since I was brought hither unto this day, but in thee, O Lord, the God of Abraham.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>O God, who art mighty above all, hear the voice of them, that have no other hope, and deliver us from the hand of the wicked, and deliver me from my fear. </div><ul class='tnav'>
