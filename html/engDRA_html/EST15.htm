I am thy brother, fear not.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Thou shalt not die: for this law is not made for thee, but for all others.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Come near then, and touch the sceptre.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And as she held her peace, he took the golden sceptre, and laid it upon her neck, and kissed her, and said: Why dost thou not speak to me?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>She answered: I saw thee, my lord, as an angel of God, and my heart was troubled for fear of thy majesty.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For thou, my lord, art very admirable, and thy. face is full of graces.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And while she was speaking, she fell down again, and was almost in a swoon.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But the king was troubled, and all his servants comforted her. </div><ul class='tnav'>
