<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 2</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>After this there went a man of the house of Levi; and took a wife of his own kindred.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And she conceived, and bore a son; and seeing him a goodly child hid him three months.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And when she could hide him no longer, she took a basket made of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and pitch: and put the little babe therein, and laid him in the sedges by the river’s brink,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>His sister standing afar off, and taking notice what would be done.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And behold the daughter of Pharao came down to wash herself in the river: and her maids walked by the river’s brink. And when she saw the basket in the sedges, she sent one of her maids for it: and when it was brought,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>She opened it and seeing within it an infant crying, having compassion on it she said: This is one of the babes of the Hebrews.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the child’s sister said to her Shall I go and call to thee a Hebrew woman, to nurse the babe?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>She answered: Go. The maid went and called her mother.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Pharao’s daughter said to her. Take this child and nurse him for me: I will give thee thy wages. The woman took, and nursed the child: and when he was grown up, she delivered him to Pharao’s daughter.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And she adopted him for a son, and called him Moses, saying: Because I took him out of the water.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>In those days after Moses was grown up, he went out to his brethren: and saw their affliction, and an Egyptian striking one of the Hebrews his brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And when he had looked about this way and that way, and saw no one there, he slew the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And going out the next day, he saw two Hebrews quarrelling: and he said to him that did the wrong: Why strikest thou thy neighbour?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But he answered: Who hath appointed thee prince and judge over us? Wilt thou kill me, as thou didst yesterday kill the Egyptian? Moses feared, and said: How is this come to be known?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Pharao heard of this word and sought to kill Moses: but he fled from his sight, and abode in the land of Madian, and he sat down by a well.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the priest of Madian had seven daughters, who came to draw water: and when the troughs were filled, desired to water their father’s flocks.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the shepherds came and drove them away: and Moses arose, and defending the maids, watered their sheep.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And when they returned to Raguel their father, he said to them: Why are ye come sooner than usual?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>They answered: A man of Egypt delivered us from the hands of the shepherds: and he drew water also with us, and gave the sheep to drink.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But he said: Where is he? why have you let the man go? call him that he may eat bread.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Moses swore that he would dwell with him. And he took Sephora his daughter to wife:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And she bore him a son, whom he called Gersam, saying: I have been a stranger in a foreign country. And she bore another, whom he called Eliezer, saying: For the God of my father, my helper hath delivered me out of the hand of Pharao.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Now after a long time the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel groaning, cried out because of the works: and their cry went up unto God from the works.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he heard their groaning, and remembered the covenant which he made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And the Lord looked upon the children of Israel, and he knew them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
