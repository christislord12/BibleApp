He answered: A rod.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And the Lord said: Cast it down upon the ground. He cast it down, and it was turned into a serpent: so that Moses fled from it.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the Lord said: Put out thy hand and take it by the tail. He put forth his hand, and took hold of it, and it was turned into a rod.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>That they may believe, saith he, that the Lord God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared to thee.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the Lord said again: Put thy hand into thy bosom. And when he had put it into his bosom, he brought it forth leprous as snow.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And he said: Put back thy hand into thy bosom. He put it back, and brought it out again, and it was like the other flesh.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>If they will not believe thee, saith he, nor hear the voice of the former sign, they will believe the word of the latter sign.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But if they will not even believe these two signs, nor hear thy voice: take of the river water, and pour it out upon the dry land, and whatsoever thou drawest out of the river shall be turned into blood.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Moses said: I beseech thee, Lord. I am not eloquent from yesterday and the day before: and since thou hast spoken to thy servant, I have more impediment and slowness of tongue.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The Lord said to him: Who made man’s mouth? or who made the dumb and the deaf, the seeing and the blind? did not I?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Go therefore and I will be in thy mouth: and I will teach thee what thou shalt speak.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But he said: I beseech thee, Lord send whom thou wilt send.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The Lord being angry at Moses, said Aaron the Levite is thy brother, I know that he is eloquent: behold he cometh forth to meet thee, and seeing thee shall be glad at heart.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Speak to him, and put my words in his mouth: and I will be in thy mouth, and in his mouth, and will shew you what you must do.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He shall speak in thy stead to the people, and shall be thy mouth: but thou shalt be to him in those things that pertain to God.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And take this rod in thy hand, wherewith thou shalt do the signs.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Moses went his way, and returned to Jethro his father in law and said to him: I will go and return to my brethren into Egypt, that I may see if they be yet alive. And Jethro said to him: Go in peace.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Moses, in Madian: Go, and return into Egypt: for they are all dead that sought thy life.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Moses therefore took his wife, and his sons, and set them upon an ass: and returned into Egypt, carrying the rod of God in his hand.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the Lord said to him as he was returning into Egypt: See that thou do all the wonders before Pharao, which I have put in thy hand: I shall harden his heart, and he will not let the people go.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And thou shalt say to him: Thus saith the Lord: Israel is my son, my firstborn.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>I have said to thee: Let my son go, that he may serve me, and thou wouldst not let him go: behold I will kill thy son, thy firstborn.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And when he was in his journey, in the inn, the Lord met him, and would have killed him.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Immediately Sephora took a very sharp stone, and circumcised the fore skin of her son, and touched his feet and said: A bloody spouse art thou to me.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And he let him go after she had said A bloody spouse art thou to me, because of the circumcision.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Aaron: Go into the desert to meet Moses. And he went forth to meet him in the mountain of God, and kissed him.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord, by which he had sent him, and the signs that he had commanded.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And they came together, and they assembled all the ancients of the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Aaron spoke all the words which the Lord had said to Moses: and he wrought the signs before the people,  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And the people believed. And they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel: and that he had looked upon their affliction: and falling down they adored. </div><ul class='tnav'>
