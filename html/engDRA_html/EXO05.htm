I know not the Lord, neither will I let Israel go.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And they said: The God of the Hebrews hath called us, to go three days’ journey into the wilderness and to sacrifice to the Lord our God: lest a pestilence or the sword fall upon us.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The king of Egypt said to them: Why do you Moses and Aaron draw off the people from their works? Get you gone to your burdens.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And Pharao said: The people of the land is numerous: you see that the multitude is increased: how much more if you give them rest from their works?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Therefore he commanded the same day the overseers of the works, and the taskmasters of the people, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>You shall give straw no more to the people to make brick, as before: but let them go and gather straw.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And you shall lay upon them the task of bricks, which they did before, neither shall you diminish any thing thereof: for they are idle, and therefore they cry, saying: Let us go and sacrifice to our God.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Let them be oppressed, with works, and let them fulfill them: that they may not regard lying words.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the overseers of the works and the taskmasters went out and said to the people: Thus saith Pharao, I allow you no straw:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Go, and gather it where you can find it: neither shall any thing of your work be diminished.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the people was scattered through all the land of Egypt to gather straw.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the overseers of the works pressed them, saying: Fulfill your work every day as before you were wont to do when straw was given you.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And they that were over the works of the children of Israel were scourged by Pharao’s taskmasters, saying: Why have you not made up the task of bricks both yesterday and today as before?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the officers of the children of Israel came, and cried out to Pharao, saying: Why dealest thou so with thy servants?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Straw is not given us, and bricks are required of us as before: behold we thy servants are beaten with whips, and thy people is unjustly dealt withal.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he said: You are idle, and therefore you say: Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Go therefore, and work: straw shall not be given you, and you shall deliver the accustomed number of bricks.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in evil case, because it was said to them: There shall not a whit be diminished of the bricks for every day.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood over against them as they came out from Pharao:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And they said to them: The Lord see and judge, because you have made our savour to stink before Pharao and his servants, and you have given him a sword to kill us.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Moses returned to the Lord, and said: Lord, why hast thou afflicted this people? wherefore hast thou sent me?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For since the time that I went in to Pharao to speak in thy name, he hath afflicted thy people: and thou hast not delivered them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
