And every firstborn of men thou shalt redeem with a price.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And when thy son shall ask thee tomorrow, saying: What is this? thou shalt answer him: With a strong hand did the Lord bring us forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For when Pharao was hardened, and would not let us go, the Lord slew every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of man to the firstborn of beasts: therefore I sacrifice to the Lord all that openeth the womb of the male sex, and all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And it shall be as a sign in thy hand, and as a thing hung between thy eyes, for a remembrance: because the Lord hath brought us forth out of Egypt by a strong hand.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And when Pharao had sent out the people, the Lord led them not by the way of the land of the Philistines which is near: thinking lest perhaps they would repent, if they should see wars arise against them, and would return into Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But he led them about by the way of the desert, which is by the Red Sea: and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Moses took Joseph’s bones with him: because he had adjured the children of Israel, saying: God shall visit you, carry out my bones from hence with you.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And marching from Socoth they encamped in Etham in the utmost coasts of the wilderness.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the Lord went before them to shew the way by day in a pillar of a cloud, and by night in a pillar of fire: that he might be the guide of their journey at both times.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>There never failed the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, before the people. </div><ul class='tnav'>
