There he appointed him ordinances, and judgments, and there he proved him,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Saying: If thou wilt hear the voice of the Lord thy God, and do what is right before him, and obey his commandments, and keep all his precepts, none of the evils that I laid upon Egypt, will I bring upon thee: for I am the Lord thy healer.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the children of Israel came into Elim, where there were twelve fountains of water, and seventy palm trees: and they encamped by the waters. </div><ul class='tnav'>
