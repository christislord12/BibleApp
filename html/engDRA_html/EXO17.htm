And Moses answered them: Why chide you with me? Wherefore do you tempt the Lord?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>So the people were thirsty there for want of water, and murmured against Moses, saying: Why didst thou make us go forth out of Egypt, to kill us and our children, and our beasts with thirst?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And Moses cried to the Lord, saying: What shall I do to this people? Yet a little more and they will stone me.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Moses: God before the people, and take with thee of the ancients of Israel: and take in thy hand the rod wherewith thou didst strike the river, and go.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Behold I will stand there before thee, upon the rock Horeb: and thou shalt strike the rock, and water shall come out of it that the people may drink. Moses did so before the ancients of Israel:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And he called the name of that place Temptation, because the chiding of the children of Israel, and for that they tempted the Lord, saying: Is the Lord amongst us or not?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Amalec came, and fought against Israel in Raphidim.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Moses said to Josue: Choose out men: and go out and fight against Amalec: tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill having the rod of God in my hand.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Josue did as Moses had spoken, and he fought against Amalec; but Moses, and Aaron, and Hur went up upon the top of the hill.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And when Moses lifted up his hands, Israel overcame: but if he let them down a little, Amalec overcame.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Moses’ hands were heavy: so they took a stone, and put under him, and he sat on it: and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands on both sides. And it came to pass that his hands were not weary until sunset.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Josue put Amalec and his people to flight, by the edge of the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Moses: Write this for a memorial in a book, and deliver it to the ears of Josue: for I will destroy the memory of Amalec from under heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Moses built an altar: and called the name thereof, The Lord my exaltation, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Because the hand of the throne of the Lord, and the war of the Lord shall be against Amalec, from generation to generation. </div><ul class='tnav'>
