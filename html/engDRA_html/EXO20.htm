But Moses went to the dark cloud wherein God was.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Moses: Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel: You have seen that I have spoken to you from heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>You shall not make gods of silver, nor shall you make to yourselves gods of gold.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>You shall make an altar of earth unto me, and you shall offer upon it your holocausts and peace offerings, your sheep and oxen, in every place where the memory of my name shall be: I will come to thee, and will bless thee.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And if thou make an altar of stone unto me, thou shalt not build it of hewn stones: for if thou lift up a tool upon it, it shall be defiled.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Thou shalt not go up by steps unto my altar, lest thy nakedness be discovered. </div><ul class='tnav'>
