You have Aaron and Hur with you: if any question shall arise, you shall refer it to them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And when Moses was gone up, a cloud covered the mount.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the glory of the Lord dwelt upon Sinai, covering it with a cloud six days: and the seventh day he called him out of the midst of the cloud.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the sight of the glory of the Lord was like a burning fire upon the top of the mount, in the eyes of the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Moses, entering into the midst of the cloud, went up into the mountain: and he was there forty days, and forty nights. </div><ul class='tnav'>
