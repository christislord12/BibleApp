And I have put wisdom in the heart of every skillful man, that they may make all things which I have commanded thee,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The tabernacle of the covenant, and the ark of the testimony, and the propitiatory that is over it, and all the vessels of the tabernacle,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the table and the vessels thereof, the most pure candlestick with the vessels thereof, and the altars of incense,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And of holocaust, and all their vessels, the laver with its foot,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The holy vestments in the ministry for Aaron the priest, and for his sons, that they may execute their office about the sacred things:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The oil of unction, and the incense of spices in the sanctuary, all things which I have commanded thee, shall they make.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: See that thou keep my sabbath: because it is a sign between me and you in your generations: that you may know that I am the Lord, who sanctify you.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Keep you my sabbath: for it is holy unto you: he that shall profane it, shall be put to death: he that shall do my work in it, his soul shall perish out of the midst of his people.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Six days shall you do work: in the seventh day is the sabbath, the rest holy to the Lord. Every one that shall do any work on this day, shall die.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Let the children of Israel keep the sabbath, and celebrate it in their generations. It is an everlasting covenant  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Between me and the children of Israel, and a perpetual sign. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and in the seventh he ceased from work.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the Lord, when he had ended these words in mount Sinai, gave to Moses two stone tables of testimony, written with the finger of God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
