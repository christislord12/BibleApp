From the shaft whereof its branches, its cups, and bowls, and lilies came out:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Six on the two sides: three branches on one side, and three on the other.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Three cups in manner of a nut on each branch, and bowls withal and lilies; and three cups of the fashion of a nut in another branch, and bowls withal and lilies. The work of the six branches that went out from the shaft of the candlestick was equal.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And in the shaft itself were four cups after the manner of a nut, and bowls withal at every one, and lilies:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And bowls under two branches in three places, which together make six branches going out from one shaft.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So both the bowls, and the branches were of the same, all beaten work of the purest gold.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>He made also the seven lamps with their snuffers, and the vessels where the snuffings were to be put out, of the purest gold.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The candlestick with all the vessels thereof weighed a talent of gold.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>He made also the altar of incense of setim wood, being a cubit on every side foursquare, and in height two cubits: from the corners of which went out horns.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And he overlaid it with the purest gold, with its grate and the sides, and the horns.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And he made to it a crown of gold round about, and two golden rings under the crown at each side, that the bars might be put into them, and the altar be carried.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the bars themselves he made also of setim wood, and overlaid them with plates of gold.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>He compounded also the oil for the ointment of sanctification, and incense of the purest spices, according to the work of a perfumer. </div><ul class='tnav'>
