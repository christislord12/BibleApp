In the first row was a sardius, a topaz, and emerald.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>In the second, a carbuncle, a sapphire, and a jasper.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>In the third, a ligurius, an agate, and an amethyst.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>In the fourth, a chrysolite, an onyx, and a beryl, set and enclosed in gold by their rows.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the twelve stones were engraved with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel, each one with its several name.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>They made also in the rational little chains linked one to another of the purest gold,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And two hooks, and as many rings of gold. And they set the rings on either side of the rational,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>On which rings the two golden chains should hang, which they put into the hooks that stood out in the corners of the ephod.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>These both before and behind so answered one another, that the ephod and the rational were bound together,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Being fastened to the girdle and strongly coupled with rings, which a violet fillet joined, lest they should flag loose, and be moved one from the other, as the Lord commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>They made also the tunick of the ephod all of violet,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And a hole for the head in the upper part at the middle, and a woven border round about the hole:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And beneath at the feet pomegranates of violet, purple, scarlet, and fine twisted linen:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And little bells of the purest gold, which they put between the pomegranates at the bottom of the tunick round about:  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>To wit, a bell of gold, and a pomegranate, wherewith the high priest went adorned, when he discharged his ministry, as the Lord had commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>They made also fine linen tunicks with woven work for Aaron and his sons:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And mitres with their little crowns of fine linen:  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And linen breeches of fine linen:  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And a girdle of fine twisted linen, violet, purple, and scarlet twice dyed, of embroidery work, as the Lord had commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>They made also the plate of sacred veneration of the purest gold, and they wrote on it with the engraving of a lapidary, The Holy of the Lord:  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And they fastened it to the mitre with a violet fillet, as the Lord had commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>So all the work of the tabernacle and of the roof of the testimony was finished: and the children of Israel did all things which the Lord had commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And they offered the tabernacle and the roof and the whole furniture, the rings, the boards, the bars, the pillars, and their sockets,  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>The cover of rams’ skins dyed red, and the other cover of violet skins,  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>The veil, the ark, the bars, the propitiatory,  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>The table, with the vessels thereof, and the loaves of proposition:  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>The candlestick, the lamps, and the furniture of them with the oil:  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>The altar of gold, and the ointment, and the incense of spices:  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And the hanging in the entry of the tabernacle:  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>The altar of brass, the grate, the bars, and all the vessels thereof: the laver with the foot thereof: the hangings of the court, and the pillars with their sockets:  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>The hanging in the entry of the court, and the little cords, and the pins thereof. Nothing was wanting of the vessels, that were commanded to be made for the ministry of the tabernacle, and for the roof of the covenant.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>The vestments also, which the priests, to wit, Aaron and his sons, used in the sanctuary,  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>The children of Israel offered as the Lord had commanded.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And when Moses saw all things finished, he blessed them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
