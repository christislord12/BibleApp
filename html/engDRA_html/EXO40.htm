The candlestick shall stand with its lamps,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the altar of gold whereon the incense is burnt, before the ark of the testimony. Thou shalt put the hanging in the entry of the tabernacle,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And before it the altar of holocaust:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The laver between the altar and the tabernacle, and thou shalt fill it with water.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And thou shalt encompass the court with hangings, and the entry thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And thou shalt take the oil of unction and anoint the tabernacle with its vessels, that they may be sanctified:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The altar of holocaust and all its vessels:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The laver with its foot: thou shalt consecrate all with the oil of unction, that they may be most holy.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tabernacle of the testimony, and having washed them with water,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Thou shalt put on them the holy vestments, that they may minister to me, and that the unction of them may prosper to an everlasting priesthood.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Moses did all that the Lord had commanded.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So in the first month of the second year, the first day of the month, the tabernacle was set up.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Moses reared it up, and placed the boards and the sockets and the bars, and set up the pillars,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And spread the roof over the tabernacle, putting over it a cover, as the Lord had commanded.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he put the testimony in the ark, thrusting bars underneath, and the oracle above.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And when he had brought the ark into the tabernacle, he drew the veil before it to fulfill the commandment of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he set the table in the tabernacle of the testimony at the north side without the veil,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Setting there in order the loaves of proposition, as the Lord had commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>He set the candlestick also in the tabernacle of the testimony over against the table on the south side,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Placing the lamps in order, according to the precept of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>He set also the altar of gold under the roof of the testimony over against the veil,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And burnt upon it the incense of spices, as the Lord had commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And he put also the hanging in the entry of the tabernacle of the testimony,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the altar of holocaust of the entry of the testimony, offering the holocaust, and the sacrifices upon it, as the Lord had commanded.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And he set the laver between the tabernacle of the testimony and the altar, filling it with water.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Moses and Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and feet,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>When they went into the tabernacle of the covenant, and went to the altar, as the Lord had commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>He set up also the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, drawing the hanging in the entry thereof. After all things were perfected,  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>The cloud covered the tabernacle of the testimony, and the glory of the Lord filled it.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Neither could Moses go into the tabernacle of the covenant, the cloud covering all things and the majesty of the Lord shining, for the cloud had covered all.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>If at any time the cloud removed from the tabernacle, the children of Israel went forward by their troops:  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>If it hung over, they remained in the same place.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>For the cloud of the Lord hung over the tabernacle by day, and a fire by night, in the sight of all the children of Israel throughout all their mansions. </div><ul class='tnav'>
