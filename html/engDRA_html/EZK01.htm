They turned not when they went: but every one went straight forward.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And as for the likeness of their faces: there was the face of a man, and the face of a lion on the right side of all the four: and the face of an ox, on the left side of all the four: and the face of an eagle over all the four.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And their faces, and their wings were stretched upward: two wings of every one were joined, and two covered their bodies:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And every one of them went straight forward: whither the impulse of the spirit was to go, thither they went: and they turned not when they went.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And as for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like that of burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps. This was the vision running to and fro in the midst of the living creatures, a bright fire, and lightning going forth from the fire.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the living creatures ran and returned like flashes of lightning.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Now as I beheld the living creatures, there appeared upon the earth by the living creatures one wheel with four faces.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the appearance of the wheels, and the work of them was like the appearance of the sea: and the four had all one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the midst of a wheel.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>When they went, they went by their four parts: and they turned not when they went.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The wheels had also a size, and a height, and a dreadful appearance: and the whole body was full of eyes round about all the four.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And when the living creatures went, the wheels also went together by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels also were lifted up with them.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Whithersoever the spirit went, thither as the spirit went the wheels also were lifted up withal, and followed it: for the spirit of life was in the wheels.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>When those went these went, and when those stood these stood, and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels also were lifted up together, and followed them: for the spirit of life was in the wheels.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And over the heads of the living creatures was the likeness of the firmament, as the appearance of crystal terrible to behold, and stretched out over their heads above.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other, every one with two wings covered his body, and the other was covered in like manner.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of many waters, as it were the voice of the most high God: when they walked, it was like the voice of a multitude, like the noise of an army, and when they stood, their wings were let down.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For when a voice came from above the firmament, that was over their heads, they stood, and let down their wings.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And above the firmament that was over their heads, was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of the sapphire stone, and upon the likeness of the throne, was a likeness as of the appearance of a man above upon it.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And I saw as it were the resemblance of amber as the appearance of fire within it round about: from his loins and upward, and from his loins downward, I saw as it were the resemblance of fire shining round about.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>As the appearance of the rainbow when it is in a cloud on a rainy day: this was the appearance of the brightness round about. </div><ul class='tnav'>
