And I did eat it: and it was sweet as honey in my mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And he said to me: Son of man, go to the house of Israel, and thou shalt speak my words to them.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For thou art not sent to a people of a profound speech, and of an unknown tongue, but to the house of Israel:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Nor to many nations of a strange speech, and of an unknown tongue, whose words thou canst not understand: and if thou wert sent to them, they would hearken to thee.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But the house of Israel will not hearken to thee: because they will not hearken to me: for all the house of Israel are of a hard forehead and an obstinate heart.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Behold I have made thy face stronger than their faces: and thy forehead harder than their foreheads.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I have made thy face like an adamant and like flint: fear them not, neither be thou dismayed at their presence: for they are a provoking house.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And he said to me: Son of man, receive in thy heart, and hear with thy ears, all the words that I speak to thee:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And go get thee in to them of the captivity, to the children of thy people, and thou shalt speak to them, and shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord: If so be they will hear and will forbear.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great commotion, saying: Blessed be the glory of the Lord, from his place.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the noise of the wings of the living creatures striking one against another, and the noise of the wheels following the living creatures, and the noise of a great commotion.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The spirit also lifted me, and took me up: and I went away in bitterness in the indignation of my spirit: for the hand of the Lord was with me, strengthening me.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And I came to them of the captivity, to the heap of new corn, to them that dwelt by the river Chobar, and I sat where they sat: and I remained there seven days mourning in the midst of them.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And at the end of seven days the word of the Lord came to me, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Son of man, I have made thee a watchman to the house of Israel: and thou shalt hear the word out of my mouth, and shalt tell it them from me.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>If, when I say to the wicked, Thou shalt surely die: thou declare it not to him, nor speak to him, that he may be converted from his wicked way, and live: the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but I will require his blood at thy hand.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But if thou give warning to the wicked, and he be not converted from his wickedness, and from his evil way: he indeed shall die in his iniquity, but thou hast delivered thy soul.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Moreover if the just man shall turn away from his justice, and shall commit iniquity: I will lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die, because thou hast not given him warning: he shall die in his sin, and his justices which he hath done, shall not be remembered: but I will require his blood at thy hand.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But if thou warn the just man, that the just may not sin, and he doth not sin: living he shall live, because thou hast warned him, and thou hast delivered thy soul.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the hand of the Lord was upon me, and he said to me: Rise and go forth into the plain, and there I will speak to thee.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And I rose up, and went forth into the plain: and behold the glory of the Lord stood there, like the glory which I saw by the river Chobar: and I fell upon my face.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet: and he spoke to me, and said to me: Go in; and shut thyself up in the midst of thy house.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And thou, O son of man, behold they shall put bands upon thee, and they shall bind thee with them: and thou shalt not go forth from the midst of them.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And I will make thy tongue stick fast to the roof of thy mouth, and thou shalt be dumb, and not as a man that reproveth: because they are a provoking house.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But when I shall speak to thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: He that heareth, let him hear: and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a provoking house. </div><ul class='tnav'>
