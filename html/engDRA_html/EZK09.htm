So they began at the ancient men who mere before the house.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And he said to them: Defile the house, and ill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew them that were in the city.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the slaughter being ended I was left: and I fell upon my face, and crying, I said: Alas, alas, alas, O Lord God, wilt thou then destroy all the remnant of Israel, by pouring out thy fury upon Jerusalem?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he said to me: The iniquity of the house of Israel, and of Juda, is exceeding great, and the land is filled with blood, and the city is filled with perverseness: for they have said: The Lord hath forsaken the earth, and the Lord seeth not.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Therefore neither shall my eye spare, nor will I have pity: I will requite their way upon their head.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And behold the man that was clothed with linen, that had the inkhorn at his back, returned the word, saying: I have done as thou hast commanded me. </div><ul class='tnav'>
