And he went in, in my sight:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in, and a cloud filled the inner court.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the glory of the Lord was lifted up from above the cherub to the threshold of the house: and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was filled with the brightness of the glory of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the sound of the wings of the cherubims was heard even to the outward court as the voice of God Almighty speaking.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And when he had commanded the man that was clothed with linen, saying: Take fire from the midst of the wheels that are between the cherubims: he went in and stood beside the wheel,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And one cherub stretched out his arm from the midst of the cherubims to the fire that was between the cherubims: and he took, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen: who took it and went forth.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And there appeared in the cherubims the likeness of a man’s hand under their wings.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And I saw, and behold there were four wheels by the cherubims: one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels was to the sight like the chrysolite stone:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And as to their appearance, all four were alike: as if a wheel were in the midst of a wheel.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And when they went, they went by four ways: and they turned not when they went: but to the place whither they first turned, the rest also followed, and did not turn back.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And their whole body, and their necks, and their hands, and their wings, and the circles were full of eyes, round about the four wheels.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And these wheels he called voluble, in my hearing.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And every one had four faces: one face was the face of a cherub, and the second face, the face of a man: and in the third was the face of a lion: and in the fourth the face of an eagle.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the cherubims were lifted up: this is the living creature that I had seen by the river Chobar.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And when the cherubims went, the wheels also went by them: and when the cherubims lifted up their wings, to mount up from the earth, the wheels stayed not behind, but were by them.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>When they stood, these stood: and when they were lifted up, these were lifted up: for the spirit of life was in them.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the glory of the Lord went forth from the threshold of the temple: and stood over the cherubims.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the cherubims lifting up their wings, were raised from the earth before me: and as they went out, the wheels also followed: and it stood in the entry of the east gate of the house of the Lord: and the glory of the God of Israel was over them.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>This is the living creature, which I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chobar: and I understood that they were cherubims.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Each one had four faces, and each one had four wings: and the likeness of a man’s hand was under their wings.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And as to the likeness of their faces, they were the same faces which I had seen by the river Chobar, and their looks, and the impulse of every one to go straight forward. </div><ul class='tnav'>
