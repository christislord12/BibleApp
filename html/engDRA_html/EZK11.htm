This city is the caldron, and we the flesh.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, thou son of man.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the spirit of the Lord fell upon me, and said to me: Speak: Thus saith the Lord: Thus have you spoken, O house of Israel, for I know the thoughts of your heart.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>You have killed a great many in this city, and you have filled the streets thereof with the slain.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Your slain, whom you have laid in the midst thereof, they are the flesh, and this is the caldron: and I will bring you forth out of the midst thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>You have feared the sword, and I will bring the sword upon you, saith the Lord God.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And I will cast you out of the midst thereof, and I will deliver you into the hand of the enemies, and I will execute judgments upon you.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>You shall fall by the sword: I will judge you in the borders of Israel, and you shall know that I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>This shall not be as a caldron to you, and you shall not be as flesh in the midst thereof: I will judge you in the borders of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And you shall know that I am the Lord: because you have not walked in my commandments, and have not done my judgments, but you have done according to the judgments of the nations that; are round about you.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pheltias the son of Banaias died: and I fell down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice: and said: Alas, alas, alas, O Lord God: wilt thou make an end of all the remnant of Israel?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Son of man, thy brethren, thy brethren, thy kinsmen, and all the house of Israel, all they to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said: Get ye far from the Lord, the land is given in possession to us.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Because I have removed them far off among the Gentiles, and because I have scattered them among the countries: I will be to them a little sanctuary in the countries whither they are come.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Therefore speak to them: Thus saith the Lord God: I will gather you from among the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries wherein you are scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And they shall go in thither, and shall take away all the scandals, and all the abominations thereof from thence.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And I will give them one heart, and will put a new spirit in their bowels: and I will take away the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>That they may walk in my commandments, and keep my judgments, and do them: and that they may be my people, and I may be their God.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But as for them whose heart walketh after their scandals and abominations, I will lay their way upon their head, saith the Lord God.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and the wheels with them: and the glory of the God of Israel was over them.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city, and stood over the mount that is on the east side of the city.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the spirit lifted me up, and brought me into Chaldea, to them of the captivity, in vision, by the spirit of God: and the vision which I had seen was taken up from me.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And I spoke to them of the captivity all the words of the Lord, which he had shewn me. </div><ul class='tnav'>
