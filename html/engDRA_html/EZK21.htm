In all their gates I have set the dread of the sharp sword, the sword that is furbished to glitter, that is made ready for slaughter.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Be thou sharpened, go to the right hand, or to the left, which way soever thou hast a mind to set thy face.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And I will clap my hands together, and will satisfy my indignation: I the Lord have spoken.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And thou son of man, set thee two ways, for the sword of the king of Babylon to come: both shall come forth out of one land: and with his hand he shall draw lots, he shall consult at the head of the way of the city.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Thou shalt make a way that the sword may come to Rabbath of the children of Ammon, and to Juda unto Jerusalem the strong city.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For the king of Babylon stood in the highway, at the head of two ways, seeking divination, shuffling arrows: he inquired of the idols, and consulted entrails.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>On his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the mouth in slaughter, to lift up the voice in howling, to set engines against the gates, to cast up a mount, to build forts.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he shall be in their eyes as one consulting the oracle in vain, and imitating the leisure of sabbaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity that they may be taken.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Because you have remembered your iniquity, and have discovered your prevarications, and your sins have appeared in all your devices: because, I say, you have remembered, you shall be taken with the hand.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But thou profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come that hath been appointed in the time of iniquity:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord God: Remove the diadem, take off the crown: is it not this that hath exalted the low one, and brought down him that was high?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>I will shew it to be iniquity, iniquity, iniquity: but this was not done till he came to whom judgment belongeth, and I will give it him.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And thou son of man, prophesy, and say: Thus saith the Lord God concerning the children of Ammon, and concerning their reproach, and thou shalt say: sword, O sword, come out of the scabbard to kill, be furbished to destroy, and to glitter,  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Whilst they see vain things in thy regard, and they divine lies: to bring thee upon the necks of the wicked that are wounded, whose appointed day is come in the time of iniquity.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Return into thy sheath. I will judge thee in the place wherein thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And I will pour out upon thee my indignation: in the fire of my rage will I blow upon thee, and will give thee into the hands of men that are brutish and contrive thy destruction.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Thou shalt be fuel for the fire, thy blood shall be in the midst of the land, thou shalt be forgotten: for I the Lord have spoken it. </div><ul class='tnav'>
