 <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And I said to them: The word of the Lord came to me, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Speak to the house of Israel: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold I will profane my sanctuary, the glory of your realm, and the thing that your eyes desire, and for which your soul feareth: your sons, and your daughters, whom you have left, shall fall by the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And you shall do as I have done: you shall not cover your faces, nor shall you eat the meat of mourners.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>You shall have crowns on your heads, and shoes on your feet: you shall not lament nor weep, but you shall pine away for your iniquities, and every one shall sigh with his brother.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Ezechiel shall be unto you for a sign of things to come: according to all that he hath done, so shall you do, when this shall come to pass: and you shall know that I am the Lord God.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And thou, O son of man, behold in the day wherein I will take away from them their strength, and the joy of their glory, and the desire of their eyes, upon which their souls rest, their sons and their daughters.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>In that day when he that escapeth shall come to thee, to tell thee:  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>In that day, I say, shall thy mouth be opened to him that hath escaped, and thou shalt speak, and shalt be silent no more: and thou shalt be unto them for a sign of things to come, and you shall know that I am the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
