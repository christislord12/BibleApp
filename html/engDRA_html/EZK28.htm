 <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Thou shalt die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord God.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyre:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And say to him: Thus saith the Lord God: Thou wast the seal of resemblance, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Thou wast in the pleasures of the paradise of God: every precious stone teas thy covering: the sardius, the topaz, and the jasper, the chrysolite, and the onyx, and the beryl, the sapphire, and the carbuncle, and the emerald: gold the work of thy beauty: and thy pipes were prepared in the day that thou wast created.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Thou a cherub stretched out, and protecting, and I set thee in the holy mountain of God, thou hast walked in the midst of the stones of fire.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day of thy creation, until iniquity was found in thee.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>By the multitude of thy merchandise, thy inner parts were filled with iniquity, and thou hast sinned: and I cast thee out from the mountain of God, and destroyed thee, O covering cherub, out of the midst of the stones of fire.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And thy heart was lifted up with thy beauty: thou best lost thy wisdom in thy beauty, I have cast thee to the ground: I have set thee before the face of kings, that they might behold thee.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thy iniquities, and by the iniquity of thy traffic: therefore I will bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, to devour thee, and I will make thee as ashes upon the earth in the sight of all that see thee.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>All that shall see thee among the nations, shall be astonished at thee: thou art brought to nothing, and thou shalt never be any more.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Son of man, set thy face against Sidon: and thou shalt prophesy of it,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And shalt say: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold I come against thee, Sidon, and I will be glorified in the midst of thee: and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall execute judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And I will send into her pestilence, and blood in her streets: and they shall fall being slain by the sword on all sides in the midst thereof: and they shall know that I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the house of Israel shall have no more a stumblingblock of bitterness, nor a thorn causing pain on every side round about them, of them that are against them: and they shall know that I am the Lord God.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord God: When I shall have gathered together the house of Israel out of the people among whom they are scattered: I will be sanctified in them before the Gentiles: and they shall dwell in their own land, which I gave to my servant Jacob.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And they shall dwell therein secure, and they shall build houses, and shall plant vineyards, and shall dwell with confidence, when I shall have executed judgments upon all that are their enemies round about: and they shall know that I am the Lord their God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
