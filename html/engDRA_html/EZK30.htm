prophesy, and say: Thus saith the Lord God: Howl ye, Woe, woe to the day:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For the day is near, yea the day of the Lord is near: a cloudy day, it shall be the time of the nations.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the sword shall come upon Egypt: and there shall be dread in Ethiopia, when the wounded shall fall in Egypt, and the multitude thereof shall be taken away, and the foundations thereof shall be destroyed.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Ethiopia, and Libya, and Lydia, and all the rest of the crowd, and Chub, and the children of the land of the covenant, shall fall with them by the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord God: They also that uphold Egypt shall fall, and the pride of her empire shall be brought down: from the tower of Syene shall they fall in it by the sword, saith the Lord the God of hosts.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And they shall be desolate in the midst of the lands that are desolate, and the cities thereof shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And they shall know that I am the Lord: when I shall have set a fire in Egypt, and all the helpers thereof shall be destroyed.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>In that day shall messengers go forth from my face in ships to destroy the confidence of Ethiopia, and there shall be dread among them in the day of Egypt: because it shall certainly come.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord God: I will make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>He and his people with him, the strongest of nations, shall be brought to destroy the land: and they shall draw their swords upon Egypt: and shall fill the land with the slain.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And I will make the channels of the rivers dry, and will deliver the land into the hand of the wicked: and will lay waste the land and all that is therein by the hands of strangers, I the Lord have spoken it.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord God: I will also destroy the idols, and I will make an end of the idols of Memphis: and there shall be no more a prince of the land of Egypt: and I will cause a terror in the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And I will destroy the land of Phatures, and will make a fire in Taphnis, and will execute judgments in Alexandria.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And I will pour out my indignation upon Pelusium the strength of Egypt, and will cut off the multitude of Alexandria.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And I will make a fire in Egypt: Pelusium shall be in pain like a woman in labour, and Alexandria shall be laid waste, and in Memphis there shall be daily distresses.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The young men of Heliopolis, and of Bubastus shall fall by the sword, and they themselves shall go into captivity.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And in Taphnis the day shall be darkened, when I shall break there the sceptres of Egypt, and the pride of her power shall cease in her: a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall be led into captivity.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And I will execute judgments in Egypt: and they shall know that I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, in the seventh day of the month, that the word of the Lord came to me, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharao king of Egypt: and behold it is not bound up, to be healed, to be tied up with clothes, and swathed with linen, that it might recover strength, and hold the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Therefore, thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I come against Pharao king of Egypt, and I will break into pieces his strong arm, which is already broken: and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And I will disperse Egypt among the nations, and scatter them through the countries.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and will put my sword in his hand: and I will break the arms of Pharao, and they shall groan bitterly being slain before his face.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharao shall fall: and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have given my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall have stretched it forth upon the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And I will disperse Egypt among the nations, and will scatter them through the countries, and they shall know that I am the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
