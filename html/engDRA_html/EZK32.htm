go down and sleep with the uncircumcised.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain with the sword: the sword is given, they have drawn her down, and all her people.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The most mighty among the strong ones shall speak to him from the midst of hell, they that went down with his helpers, and slept uncircumcised, slain by the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Assur is there, and all his multitude: their graves are round about him, all of them slain, and that fell by the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Whose graves are set in the lowest parts of the pit: and his multitude lay round about his grave: all of them slain, and fallen by the sword, they that heretofore spread terror in the land of the living.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>There is Elam and all his multitude round about his grave, all of them slain, and fallen by the sword; that went down uncircumcised to the lowest parts of the earth: that caused their terror in the land of the living, and they have borne their shame with them that go down into the pit.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>In the midst of the slain they have set him a bed among all his people: their graves are round about him: all these are uncircumcised, and slain by the sword: for they spread their terror in the land of the living, and have borne their shame with them that descend into the pit: they are laid in the midst of the slain.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>There is Mosoch, and Thubal, and all their multitude: their graves are round about him: all of them uncircumcised and slain, and fallen by the sword: though they spread their terror in the land of the living.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And they shall not sleep with the brave, and with them that fell uncircumcised, that went down to hell with their weapons, and laid their swords under their heads, and their iniquities were in their bones, because they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>So thou also shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and shalt sleep with them that are slain by the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>There is Edom, and her kings, and all her princes, who with their army are joined with them that are slain by the sword: and have slept with the uncircumcised, and with them that go down into the pit.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>There are all the princes of the north, and all the hunters: who were brought down with the slain, fearing, and confounded in their strength: who slept uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword, and have borne their shame with them that go down into the pit.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Pharao saw them, and he was comforted concerning all his multitude, which was slain by the sword: Pharao, and all his army, saith the Lord God:  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Because I have spread my terror in the land of the living, and he hath slept in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword: Pharao and all his multitude, saith the Lord God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
