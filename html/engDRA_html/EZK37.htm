And I answered: O Lord God, thou knowest.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And he said to me: Prophesy concerning these bones; and say to them: Ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord God to these bones: Behold, I will send spirit into you, and you shall live.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And I will lay sinews upon you, and will cause flesh to grow over you, and will cover you with skin: and I will give you spirit and you shall live, and you shall know that I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And I prophesied as he had commanded me: and as I prophesied there was a noise, and behold a commotion: and the bones came together, each one to its joint.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And I saw, and behold the sinews, and the flesh came up upon them: and the skin was stretched out over them, but there was no spirit in them.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he said to me: Prophesy to the spirit, prophesy, O son of man, and say to the spirit: Thus saith the Lord God: Come, spirit, from the four winds, and blow upon these slain, and let them live again.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And I prophesied as he had commanded me: and the spirit came into them, and they lived: and they stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And he said to me: Son of man: All these bones are the house of Israel: they say: Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost, and we are cut off.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Therefore prophesy, and say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold I will open your graves, and will bring you out of your sepulchres, O my people: and will bring you into the land of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And you shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have opened your sepulchres, and shall have brought you out of your graves, O my people:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And shall have put my spirit in you, and you shall live, and I shall make you rest upon your own land: and you shall know that I the Lord have spoken, and done it, saith the Lord God:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And thou son of man, take thee a stick: and write upon it: Of Juda, and of the children of Israel his associates: and take another stick and write upon it: For Joseph the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel, and of his associates.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And join them one to the other into one stick, and they shall become one in thy hand.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And when the children of thy people shall speak to thee, saying: Wilt thou not tell us what thou meanest by this?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel that are associated with him, and I will put them together with the stick of Juda, and will make them one stick: and they shall be one in his hand.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the sticks whereon thou hast written, shall be in thy hand, before their eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will take the children of Israel from the midst of the nations whither they are gone: and I will gather them on every side, and will bring them to their own land.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And I will make them one nation in the land on the mountains of Israel, and one king shall be king over them all: and they shall no more be two nations, neither shall they be divided any more into two kingdoms.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Nor shall they be defiled any more with their idols, nor with their abominations, nor with all their iniquities: and I will save them out of all the places in which they have sinned, and I will cleanse them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And my servant David shall be king over them, and they shall have one shepherd: they shall walk in my judgments, and shall keep my commandments, and shall do them.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And they shall dwell in the land which I gave to my servant Jacob, wherein your fathers dwelt, and they shall dwell in it, they and their children, and their children’s children, for ever: and David my servant shall be their prince for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And I will make a covenant of peace with them, it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will establish them, and will multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And my tabernacle shall be with them: and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the nations shall know that I am the Lord the sanctifier of Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for ever. </div><ul class='tnav'>
