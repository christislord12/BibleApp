Thou shalt be in the latter days, and I will bring thee upon my land: that the nations may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord God: Thou then art he, of whom I have spoken in the days of old, by my servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in the days of those times that I would bring thee upon them.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass in that day, in the day of the coming of Gog upon the land of Israel, saith the Lord God, that my indignation shall come up in my wrath.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And I have spoken in my zeal, and in the fire of my anger, that in that day there shall be a great commotion upon the land of Israel:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>So that the fishes of the sea, and the birds of the air, and the beasts of the field, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the ground, and all men that are upon the face of the earth, shall be moved at my presence: and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the hedges shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And I will call in the sword against him in all my mountains, saith the Lord God: every man’s sword shall be pointed against his brother.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And I will judge him with pestilence, and with blood, and with violent rain, and vast hailstones: I will rain fire and brimstone upon him, and upon his army, and upon the many nations that are with him.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And I will be magnified, and I will be sanctified: and I will be known in the eyes of many nations: and they shall know that I am the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
