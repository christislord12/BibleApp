And he said to me: This is the table before the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And there were two doors in the temple, and in the sanctuary.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And in the two doors on both sides were two little doors, which were folded within each other: for there were two wickets on both sides of the doors.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And there were cherubims also wrought in the doors of the temple, and the figures of palm trees, like as were made on the walls: for which cause also the planks were thicker in the front of the porch without.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Upon which were the oblique windows, and the representation of palm trees on this side, and on that side in the sides of the porch, according to the sides of the house, and the breadth of the walls. </div><ul class='tnav'>
