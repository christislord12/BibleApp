And their doors were toward the north.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Where were the store chambers lower above: because they bore up the galleries, which appeared above out of them from the lower parts, and from the midst of the building.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For they were of three stories, and had not pillars, as the pillars of the courts: therefore did they appear above out of the lower places, and out of the middle places, fifty cubits from the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the outward wall that went about by the chambers, which were towards the outward court on the forepart of the chambers, was fifty cubits long.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For the length of the chambers of the outward court was fifty cubits: and the length before the face of the temple, a hundred cubits.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And there was under these chambers, an entrance from the east, for them that went into them out of the outward court.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>In the breadth of the outward wall of the court that was toward the east, over against the separate building, and there were chambers before the building.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the way before them was like the chambers which were toward the north: they wore as long as they, and as broad as they: and all the going is to them, and their fashions, and their doors were alike.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>According to the doors of the chambers that were towards the south: there was a door in the head of the way, which way was before the porch, separated towards the east as one entereth in.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And he said to me: The chambers of the north, and the chambers of the south, which are before the separate building: they are holy chambers, in which the priests shall eat, that approach to the Lord into the holy of holies: there they shall lay the most holy things, and the offering for sin, and for trespass: for it is a holy place.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And when the priests shall have entered in, they shall not go out of the holy places into the outward court: but there they shall lay their vestments, wherein they minister, for they are holy: and they shall put on other garments, and so they shall go forth to the people.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me out by the way of the gate that looked toward the east: and he measured it on every side round about.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And he measured toward the east with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he measured toward the north five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And towards the south he measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And toward the west he measured five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>By the four winds he measured the wall thereof on every side round about, five hundred cubits long and five hundred cubits broad, making a separation between the sanctuary and the place of the people. </div><ul class='tnav'>
