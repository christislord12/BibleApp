Shew them the form of the house, and of the fashion thereof, the goings out and the comings in, and the whole plan thereof, and all its ordinances, and all its order, and all its laws, and thou shalt write it in their sight: that they may keep the whole form thereof, and its ordinances, and do them.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>This is the law of the house upon the top of the mountain: All its border round about is most holy: this then is the law of the house.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And these are the measures of the altar by the truest cubit, which is a cubit and a handbreadth: the bottom thereof was a cubit, and the breadth a cubit: and the border thereof unto its edge, and round about, one handbreadth: and this was the trench of the altar.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And from the bottom of the ground to the lowest brim two cubits, and the breadth of one cubit: and from the lesser brim to the greater brim four cubits, and the breadth of one cubit.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the Ariel itself was four cubits: and from the Ariel upward were four horns.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the Ariel was twelve cubits long, and twelve cubits broad, foursquare, with equal sides.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the brim was fourteen cubits long, and fourteen cubits broad in the four corners thereof: and the crown round about it was half a cubit, and the bottom of it one cubit round about: and its steps turned toward the east.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he said to me: Son of man, thus saith the Lord God: These are the ceremonies of the altar, in what day soever it shall be made: that holocausts may be offered upon it, and blood poured out.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And thou shalt give to the priests, and the Levites, that are of the race of Sadoc, who approach to me, saith the Lord God, to offer to me a calf of the herd for sin.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And thou shalt take of his blood, and shalt put it upon the four horns thereof, and upon the four corners of the brim, and upon the crown round about: and thou shalt cleanse, and expiate it.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And thou shalt take the calf, that is offered for sin: and thou shalt burn him in a separate place of the house without the sanctuary.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And in the second day thou shalt offer a he goat without blemish for sin: and they shall expiate the altar, as they expiated it with the calf.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And when thou shalt have made an end of the expiation thereof, thou shalt offer a calf of the herd without blemish, and a ram of the flock without blemish.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And thou shalt offer them in the sight of the Lord: and the priests shall put salt upon them, and shall offer them a holocaust to the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Seven days shalt thou offer a he goat for sill daily: they shall offer also a calf of the herd, and a ram of the flock without blemish.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Seven days shall they expiate the altar, and shall cleanse it: and they shall consecrate it.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the days being, expired, on the eighth day and thenceforward, the priests shall offer your holocausts upon the altar, and the peace offerings: and I will be pacified towards you, saith the Lord God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
