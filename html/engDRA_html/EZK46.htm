And there was a place bending to the west.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he said to me: This is the place where the priests shall boil the sin offering, and the trespass offering: where they shall dress the sacrifice, that they may not bring it out into the outward court, and the people be sanctified.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he brought me into the outward court, and he led me about by the four corners of the court: and behold there was a little court in the corner of the court, to every corner of the court there was a little court.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>In the four corners of the court were little courts disposed, forty cubits long, and thirty broad, all the four were of one measure.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And there was a wall round about compassing the four little courts, and there were kitchens built under the rows round about.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he said to me: This is the house of the kitchens wherein the ministers of the house of the Lord shall boil the victims of the people. </div><ul class='tnav'>
