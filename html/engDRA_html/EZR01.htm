His God be with him. Let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judea, and build the house of the Lord the God of Israel: he is the God that is in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And let all the rest in all places wheresoever they dwell, help him every man from his place. with silver and gold, and goods, and cattle, besides that which they offer freely to the temple of God, which is in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Juda and Benjamin, and the priests, and Levites, and every one whose spirit God had raised up, to go up to build the temple of the Lord, which was in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And all they that were round about, helped their hands with vessels of silver, and gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with furniture, besides what they had offered on their own accord.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And king Cyrus brought forth the vessels of the temple of the Lord, which Nabuchodonosor had taken from Jerusalem, and had put them in the temple of his god.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Now Cyrus king of Persia brought them forth by the hand of Mithridates the son of Gazabar, and numbered them to Sassabasar the prince of Juda.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And this is the number of them: thirty bowls of gold, a thousand bowls of silver, nine and twenty knives, thirty cups of gold,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Silver cups of a second sort, four hundred and ten: other vessels a thousand.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>All the vessels of gold and silver, five thousand four hundred: all these Sassabasar brought with them that came up from the captivity of Babylon to Jerusalem. </div><ul class='tnav'>
