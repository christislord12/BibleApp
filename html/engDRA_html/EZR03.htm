And all the people shouted with a great shout, praising the Lord, because the foundations of the temple of the Lord were laid.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But many of the priests and the Levites, and the chief of the fathers and the ancients that had seen the former temple; when they had the foundation of this temple before their eyes, wept with a loud voice: and many shouting for joy, lifted up their voice.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So that one could not distinguish the voice of the shout of joy, from the noise of the weeping of the people: for one with another the people shouted with a loud shout, and the voice was heard afar off. </div><ul class='tnav'>
