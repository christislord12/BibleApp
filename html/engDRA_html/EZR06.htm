I Darius have made the decree, which I will have diligently complied with.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So then Thathanai, governor of the country beyond the river, and Stharbuzanai, and his counsellors diligently executed what Darius the king had commanded.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the ancients of the Jews built and prospered according to the prophecy of Aggeus the prophet, and of Zacharias the son of Addo: and they built and finished, by the commandment of the God of Israel, and by the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes kings of the Persians.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And they were finishing this house of God, until the third day of the month of Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of king Darius.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the children of Israel, the priests and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity kept the dedication of the house of God with joy.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And they offered at the dedication of the house of God, a, hundred calves, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs, and for a sin offering for all Israel twelve he goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses over the works of God in Jerusalem, as it is written in the book of Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the children of Israel of the captivity kept the phase, on the fourteenth day of the first month.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For all the priests and the Levites were purified as one man: all were clear to kill the phase for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and themselves.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the children of Israel that were returned from captivity, and all that had separated themselves from the filthiness of the nations of the earth to them, to seek the Lord the God of Israel, did eat.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And they kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy, for the Lord had made them joyful, and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria to them, that he should help their hands in the work of the house of the Lord the God of Israel. </div><ul class='tnav'>
