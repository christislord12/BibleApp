<div class='mt'>Paul’s Letter to the Galatians  
</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Paul, an apostle, not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And all the brethren who are with me, to the churches of Galatia.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Grace be to you, and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present wicked world, according to the will of God and our Father:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>To whom is glory for ever and ever. Amen.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I wonder that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ, unto another gospel.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Which is not another, only there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach a gospel to you besides that which we have preached to you, let him be anathema.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>As we said before, so now I say again: If any one preach to you a gospel, besides that which you have received, let him be anathema.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For I give you to understand, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For neither did I receive it of man, nor did I learn it; but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For you have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews’ religion: how that, beyond measure, I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And I made progress in the Jews’ religion above many of my equals in my own nation, being more abundantly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But when it pleased him, who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called me by his grace,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, immediately I condescended not to flesh and blood.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Neither went I to Jerusalem, to the apostles who were before me: but I went into Arabia, and again I returned to Damascus.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then, after three years, I went to Jerusalem, to see Peter, and I tarried with him fifteen days.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But other of the apostles I saw none, saving James the brother of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Now the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I lie not.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea, which were in Christ:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But they had heard only: He, who persecuted us in times past, doth now preach the faith which once he impugned:  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And they glorified God in me. </div><ul class='tnav'>
