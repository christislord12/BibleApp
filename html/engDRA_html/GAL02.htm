God forbid.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For if I build up again the things which I have destroyed, I make myself a prevaricator.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For I, through the law, am dead to the law, that I may live to God: with Christ I am nailed to the cross.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And I live, now not I; but Christ liveth in me. And that I live now in the flesh: I live in the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and delivered himself for me.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>I cast not away the grace of God. For if justice be by the law, then Christ died in vain. </div><ul class='tnav'>
