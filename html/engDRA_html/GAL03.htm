<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 3</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>O senseless Galatians, who hath bewitched you that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been set forth, crucified among you?  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>This only would I learn of you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Are you so foolish, that, whereas you began in the Spirit, you would now be made perfect by the flesh?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Have you suffered so great things in vain? If it be yet in vain.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>He therefore who giveth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you; doth he do it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of the faith?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>As it is written: Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him unto justice.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Know ye therefore, that they who are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the scripture, foreseeing, that God justifieth the Gentiles by faith, told unto Abraham before: In thee shall all nations be blessed.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Therefore they that are of faith, shall be blessed with faithful Abraham.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For as many as are of the works of the law, are under a curse. For it is written: Cursed is every one, that abideth not in all things, which are written in the book of the law to do them.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But that in the law no man is justified with God, it is manifest: because the just man liveth by faith.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But the law is not of faith: but, He that doth those things, shall live in them.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written: Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus: that we may receive the promise of the Spirit by faith.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Brethren (I speak after the manner of man,) yet a man’s testament, if it be confirmed, no man despiseth, nor addeth to it.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>To Abraham were the promises made and to his seed. He saith not, And to his seeds, as of many: but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Now this I say, that the testament which was confirmed by God, the law which was made after four hundred and thirty years, doth not disannul, to make the promise of no effect.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise. But God gave it to Abraham by promise.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Why then was the law? It was set because of transgressions, until the seed should come, to whom he made the promise, being ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Now a mediator is not of one: but God is one.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Was the law then against the promises of God? God forbid. For if there had been a law given which could give life, verily justice should have been by the law.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise, by the faith of Jesus Christ, might be given to them that believe.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But before the faith came, we were kept under the law shut up, unto that faith which was to be revealed.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Wherefore the law was our pedagogue in Christ, that we might be justified by faith.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But after the faith is come, we are no longer under a pedagogue.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For you are all the children of God by faith, in Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For as many of you as have been baptized in Christ, have put on Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>There is neither Jew nor Greek: there is neither bond nor free: there is neither male nor female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And if you be Christ’s, then are you the seed of Abraham, heirs according to the promise. </div><ul class='tnav'>
