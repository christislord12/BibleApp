<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 4</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Now I say, as long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed by the father:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>So we also, when we were children, were serving under the elements of the world.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent his Son, made of a woman, made under the law:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>That he might redeem them who were under the law: that we might receive the adoption of sons.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And because you are sons, God hath sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying: Abba, Father.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Therefore now he is not a servant, but a son. And if a son, an heir also through God.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But then indeed, not knowing God, you served them, who, by nature, are not gods.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But now, after that you have known God, or rather are known by God: how turn you again to the weak and needy elements, which you desire to serve again?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>You observe days, and months, and times, and years.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I am afraid of you, lest perhaps I have laboured in vain among you.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Be ye as I, because I also am as you: brethren, I beseech you: you have not injured me at all.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And you know, how through infirmity of the flesh, I preached the gospel to you heretofore: and your temptation in my flesh,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>You despised not, nor rejected: but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Where is then your blessedness? For I bear you witness, that, if it could be done, you would have plucked out your own eyes, and would have given them to me.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Am I then become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>They are zealous in your regard not well: but they would exclude you, that you might be zealous for them.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But be zealous for that which is good in a good thing always: and not only when I am present with you.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>My little children, of whom I am in labour again, until Christ be formed in you.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And I would willingly be present with you now, and change my voice: because I am ashamed for you.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, have you not read the law?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman, and the other by a free woman.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But he who was of the bondwoman, was born according to the flesh: but he of the free woman, was by promise.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Which things are said by an allegory. For these are the two testaments. The one from mount Sina, engendering unto bondage; which is Agar:  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For Sina is a mountain in Arabia, which hath affinity to that Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But that Jerusalem, which is above, is free: which is our mother.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For it is written: Rejoice, thou barren, that bearest not: break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for many are the children of the desolate, more than of her that hath a husband.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>But as then he, that was born according to the flesh, persecuted him that was after the spirit; so also it is now.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son; for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>So then, brethren, we are not the children of the bondwoman, but of the free: by the freedom wherewith Christ has made us free. </div><ul class='tnav'>
