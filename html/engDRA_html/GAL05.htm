Then is the scandal of the cross made void.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I would they were even cut off, who trouble you.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For you, brethren, have been called unto liberty: only make not liberty an occasion to the flesh, but by charity of the spirit serve one another.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For all the law is fulfilled in one word: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But if you bite and devour one another; take heed you be not consumed one of another.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I say then, walk in the spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For the flesh lusteth against the spirit: and the spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary one to another: so that you do not the things that you would.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But if you are led by the spirit, you are not under the law.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are fornication, uncleanness, immodesty, luxury,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Idolatry, witchcrafts, enmities, contentions, emulations, wraths, quarrels, dissensions, sects,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Envies, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like. Of the which I foretell you, as I have foretold to you, that they who do such things shall not obtain the kingdom of God.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But the fruit of the Spirit is, charity, joy, peace, patience, benignity, goodness, longanimity,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Mildness, faith, modesty, continency, chastity. Against such there is no law.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And they that are Christ’s, have crucified their flesh, with the vices and concupiscences.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Let us not be made desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying on another. </div><ul class='tnav'>
