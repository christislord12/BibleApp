And the fourth river is Euphrates.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the Lord God took man, and put him into the paradise of pleasure, to dress it, and to keep it.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And he commanded him, saying: Of every tree of paradise thou shalt eat:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat. For in what day soever thou shalt eat of it, thou shalt die the death.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the Lord God said: It is not good for man to be alone: let us make him a help like unto himself.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the Lord God having formed out of the ground all the beasts of the earth, and all the fowls of the air, brought them to Adam to see what he would call them: for whatsoever Adam called any living creature the same is its name.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Adam called all the beasts by their names, and all the fowls of the air, and all the cattle of the field: but for Adam there was not found a helper like himself.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then the Lord God cast a deep sleep upon Adam: and when he was fast asleep, he took one of his ribs, and filled up flesh for it.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the Lord God built the rib which he took from Adam into a woman: and brought her to Adam.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Adam said: This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, because she was taken out of man.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Wherefore a man shall leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they shall be two in one flesh.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And they were both naked: to wit, Adam and his wife: and were not ashamed. </div><ul class='tnav'>
