And Abel was a shepherd, and Cain a husbandman.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And it came to pass after many days, that Cain offered, of the fruits of the earth, gifts to the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Abel also offered of the firstlings of his flock, and of their fat: and the Lord had respect to Abel, and to his offerings.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But to Cain and his offerings he had no respect: and Cain was exceedingly angry, and his countenance fell.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the Lord said to him: Why art thou angry? and why is thy countenance fallen?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>If thou do well, shalt thou not receive? but if ill, shall not sin forthwith be present at the door? but the lust thereof shall be under thee, and thou shalt have dominion over it.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Cain said to Abel his brother: Let us go forth abroad. And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and slew him.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Cain: Where is thy brother Abel? And he answered, I know not: am I my brother’s keeper?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And he said to him: What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth to me from the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Now, therefore, cursed shalt thou be upon the earth, which hath opened her mouth and received the blood of thy brother at thy hand.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>When thou shalt till it, it shall not yield to thee its fruit: a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be upon the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Cain said to the Lord: My iniquity is greater than that I may deserve pardon.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Behold thou dost cast me out this day from the face of the earth, and I shall be hidden from thy face, and I shall be a vagabond and a fugitive on the earth: every one, therefore, that findeth me, shall kill me.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the Lord said to him: No, it shall not be so: but whosoever shall kill Cain, shall be punished sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark upon Cain, that whosoever found him should not kill him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Cain went out from the face of the Lord, and dwelt as a fugitive on the earth, at the east side of Eden.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived, and brought forth Henoch: and he built a city, and called the name thereof by the name of his son Henoch.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Henoch begot Irad, and Irad begot Maviael, and Maviael begot Mathusael, and Mathusael begot Lamech:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Who took two wives: the name of the one was Ada, and the name of the other Sella.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Ada brought forth Jabel: who was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of herdsmen.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And his brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of them that play upon the harp and the organs.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Sella also brought forth Tubalcain, who was a hammerer and artificer in every work of brass and iron. And the sister of Tubalcain was Noema.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Lamech said to his wives Ada and Sella: Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech: for I have slain a man to the wounding of myself, and a stripling to my own bruising.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Sevenfold vengeance shall be taken for Cain: but for Lamech seventy times sevenfold.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Adam also knew his wife again: and she brought forth a son, and called his name Seth, saying: God hath given me another seed, for Abel whom Cain slew.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But to Seth also was born a son, whom he called Enos; this man began to call upon the name of the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
