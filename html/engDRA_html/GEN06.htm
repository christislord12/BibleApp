For after the sons of God went in to the daughters of men, and they brought forth children, these are the mighty men of old, men of renown.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And God seeing that the wickedness of men was great on the earth, and that all the thought of their heart was bent upon evil at all times,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>It repented him that he had made man on the earth. And being touched inwardly with sorrow of heart,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>He said: I will destroy man, whom I have created, from the face of the earth, from man even to beasts, from the creeping thing even to the fowls of the air, for it repenteth me that I have made them.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But Noe found grace before the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>These are the generations of Noe: Noe was a just and perfect man in his generations, he walked with God.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And he begot three sons, Sem, Cham, and Japheth.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the earth was corrupted before God, and was filled with iniquity.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And when God had seen that the earth was corrupted (for all flesh had corrupted its way upon the earth,)  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He said to Noe: The end of all flesh is come before me, the earth is filled with iniquity through them, and I will destroy them with the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Make thee an ark of timber planks: thou shalt make little rooms in the ark, and thou shalt pitch it within and without.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And thus shalt thou make it: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits: the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Thou shalt make a window in the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish the top of it: and the door of the ark thou shalt set in the side: with lower, middle chambers, and third stories shalt thou make it.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Behold I will bring the waters of a great flood upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, under heaven. All things that are in the earth shall be consumed.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And I will establish my covenant with thee, and thou shalt enter into the ark, thou and thy sons, and thy wife, and the wives of thy sons with thee.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And of every living creature of all flesh, thou shalt bring two of a sort into the ark, that they may live with thee: of the male sex, and the female.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Of fowls according to their kind, and of beasts in their kind, and of every thing that creepeth on the earth according to its kind; two of every sort shall go in with thee, that they may live.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Thou shalt take unto thee of all food that may be eaten, and thou shalt lay it up with thee: and it shall be food for thee and them.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Noe did all things which God commanded him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
