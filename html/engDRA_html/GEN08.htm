Noe therefore understood that the waters were ceased upon the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he stayed yet other seven days: and he sent forth the dove, which returned not any more unto him.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Therefore in the six hundredth and first year, the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were lessened upon the earth, and Noe opening the covering of the ark, looked, and saw that the face of the earth was dried.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>In the second month, the seven and twentieth day of the month, the earth was dried.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And God spoke to Noe, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Go out of the ark, thou and thy wife, thy sons, and the wives of thy sons with thee.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>All living things that are with thee of all flesh, as well in fowls as in beasts, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, bring out with thee, and go ye upon the earth: increase and multiply upon it.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>So Noe went out, he and his sons: his wife, and the wives of his sons with him.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And all living things, and cattle, and creeping things that creep upon the earth, according to their kinds, went out of the ark.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Noe built an altar unto the Lord: and taking of all cattle and fowls that were clean, offered holocausts upon the altar.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the Lord smelled a sweet savour, and said: I will no more curse the earth for the sake of man: for the imagination and thought of man’s heart are prone to evil from his youth: therefore I will no more destroy every living soul as I have done.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>All the days of the earth, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, night and day, shall not cease. </div><ul class='tnav'>
