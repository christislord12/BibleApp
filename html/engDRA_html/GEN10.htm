The sons of Regma: Saba and Dadan.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Now Chus begot Nemrod: he began to be mighty on the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he was a stout hunter before the Lord. Hence came a proverb: Even as Nemrod the stout hunter before the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the beginning of his kingdom was Babylon, and Arach, and Achad, and Chalanne in the land of Sennaar.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Out of that land came forth Assur, and built Ninive, and the streets of the city, and Chale.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Resen also between Ninive and Chale: this is the great city.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Mesraim begot Ludim, and Anamim, and Laabim, Nepthuim,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Phetrusim, and Chasluim; of whom came forth the Philistines, and the Capthorim.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Chanaan begot Sidon, his firstborn, the Hethite,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the Jebusite, and the Amorrhite, and the Gergesite,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The Hevite and the Aracite: the Sinite,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the Aradian, the Samarite, and the Hamathite: and afterwards the families of the Chanaanites were spread abroad.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the limits of Chanaan were from Sidon as one comes to Gerara even to Gaza, until thou enter Sodom and Gomorrha, and Adama, and Seboim even to Lesa.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>These are the children of Cham in their kindreds, and tongues, and generations, and lands, and nations.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Of Sem also, the father of all the children of Heber, the elder brother of Japheth, sons were born.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The sons of Sem: Elam and Assur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The sons of Aram: Us and Hull, and Gether, and Mess.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But Arphaxad begot Sale, of whom was born Heber.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And to Heber were born two sons: the name of the one was Phaleg, because in his days the earth was divided: and his brother’s name Jectan.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Which Jectan begot Elmodad, and Saleph, and Asarmoth, Jare,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Aduram, and Uzal, and Decla,  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Ebal, and Abimael, Saba,  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Ophir, and Hevila, and Jobab. All these were the sons of Jectan.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And their dwelling was from Messa as we go on as far as Sephar, a mountain in the east.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>These are the children of Sem according to their kindreds and tongues, and countries in their nations.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>These are the families of Noe, according to their peoples and nations. By these were the nations divided on the earth after the flood. </div><ul class='tnav'>
