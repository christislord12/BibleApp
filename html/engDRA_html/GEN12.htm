And when they were come into it,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Abram passed through the country into the place of Sichem, as far as the noble vale: now the Chanaanite was at that time in the land.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the Lord appeared to Abram, and said to him: To thy seed will I give this land. And he built there an altar to the Lord, who had appeared to him.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And passing on from thence to a mountain, that was on the east side of Bethel, he there pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east; he built there also an altar to the Lord, and called upon his name.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Abram went forward, going, and proceeding on to the south.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And there came a famine in the country; and Abram went down into Egypt, to sojourn there: for the famine was very grievous in the land.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And when he was near to enter into Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife: I know that thou art a beautiful woman:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And that when the Egyptians shall see thee, they will say: She is his wife: and they will kill me, and keep thee.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Say, therefore, I pray thee, that thou art my sister: that I may be well used for thee, and that my soul may live for thy sake.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians saw the woman that she was very beautiful.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the princes told Pharao, and praised her before him: and the woman was taken into the house of Pharao.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And they used Abram well for her sake. And he had sheep and oxen, and he asses, and men servants and maid servants, and she asses, and camels.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But the Lord scourged Pharao and his house with most grievous stripes for Sarai, Abram’s wife.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Pharao called Abram, and said to him: What is this that thou hast done to me? Why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For what cause didst thou say, she was thy sister, that I might take her to my wife? Now, therefore, there is thy wife, take her, and go thy way.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Pharao gave his men orders concerning Abram: and they led him away, and his wife, and all that he had. </div><ul class='tnav'>
