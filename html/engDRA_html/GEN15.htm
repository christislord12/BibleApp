I shall go without children: and the son of the steward of my house is this Damascus Eliezer.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And Abram added: But to me thou hast not given seed: and lo my servant, born in my house, shall be my heir.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And immediately the word of the Lord came to him, saying: He shall not be thy heir: but he that shall come out of thy bowels, him shalt thou have for thy heir.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And he brought him forth abroad, and said to him: Look up to heaven and number the stars, if thou canst. And he said to him: So shall thy seed be.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Abram believed God, and it was reputed to him unto justice.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And he said to him: I am the Lord who brought thee out from Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land, and that thou mightest possess it.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But he said: Lord God, whereby may I know that I shall possess it?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the Lord answered, and said: Take me a cow of three years old, and a she goat of three years, and a ram of three years, a turtle also, and a pigeon.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And he took all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid the two pieces of each one against the other; but the birds he divided not.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the fowls came down upon the carcasses, and Abram drove them away.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And when the sun was setting, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and a great and darksome horror seized upon him.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And it was said unto him: Know thou beforehand that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land not their own, and they shall bring them under bondage, and afflict them four hundred years.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But I will judge the nation which they shall serve, and after this they shall come out with great substance.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace, and be buried in a good old age.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But in the fourth generation they shall return hither: for as yet the iniquities of the Amorrhites are not at the full until this present time.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And when the sun was set, there arose a dark mist, and there appeared a smoking furnace and a lamp of fire passing between those divisions.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>That day God made a covenant with Abram, saying: To thy seed will I give this land, from the river of Egypt even to the great river Euphrates.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The Cineans and Cenezites, the Cedmonites,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the Hethites, and the Pherezites, the Raphaim also,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the Amorrhites, and the Chanaanites, and the Gergesites, and the Jebusites. </div><ul class='tnav'>
