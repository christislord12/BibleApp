And when he agreed to her request,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>She took Agar the Egyptian her handmaid, ten years after they first dwelt in the land of Chanaan, and gave her to her husband to wife.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And he went in to her. But she, perceiving that she was with child, despised her mistress.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And Sarai said to Abram: Thou dost unjustly with me: I gave my handmaid into thy bosom, and she perceiving herself to be with child, despiseth me. The Lord judge between me and thee.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Abram made answer, and said to her: Behold thy handmaid is in thy own hand, use her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai afflicted her, she ran away.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the angel of the Lord having found her, by a fountain of water in the wilderness, which is in the way to Sur in the desert,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>He said to her: Agar, handmaid of Sarai, whence comest thou? and whither goest thou? And she answered: I flee from the face of Sarai, my mistress.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the angel of the Lord said to her: Return to thy mistress, and humble thyself under her hand.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And again he said: I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, and it shall not be numbered for multitude.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And again: Behold, said he, thou art with child, and thou shalt bring forth a son: and thou shalt call his name Ismael, because the Lord hath heard thy affliction.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>He shall be a wild man: his hand will be against all men, and all men’s hands against him: and he shall pitch his tents over against all his brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And she called the name of the Lord that spoke unto her: Thou the God who hast seen me. For she said: Verily here have I seen the hinder parts of him that seeth me.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Therefore she called that well, The well of him that liveth and seeth me. The same is between Cades and Barad.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Agar brought forth a son to Abram: who called his name Ismael.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Abram was four score and six years old when Agar brought him forth Ismael. </div><ul class='tnav'>
