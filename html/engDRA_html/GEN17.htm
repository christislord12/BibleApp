Behold, I will bless him, and increase, and multiply him exceedingly: he shall beget twelve chiefs, and I will make him a great nation.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sara shall bring forth to thee at this time in the next year.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And when he had left off speaking with him, God went up from Abraham.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Abraham took Ismael his son, and all that were born in his house: and all whom he had bought, every male among the men of his house: and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskin forthwith the very same day, as God had commanded him.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Abraham was ninety and nine years old, when he circumcised the flesh of his foreskin.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Ismael his son was full thirteen years old at the time of his circumcision.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>The selfsame day was Abraham circumcised and Ismael his son.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And all the men of his house, as well they that were born in his house, as the bought servants and strangers were circumcised with him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
