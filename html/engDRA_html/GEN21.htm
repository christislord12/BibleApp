<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 21</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And the Lord visited Sara, as he had promised: and fulfilled what he had spoken.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And she conceived and bore a son in her old age, at the time that God had foretold her.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And Abraham called the name of his son, whom Sara bore him, Isaac.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And he circumcised him the eighth day, as God had commanded him,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>When he was a hundred years old: for at this age of his father was Isaac born.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Sara said: God hath made a laughter for me: whosoever shall hear of it will laugh with me.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And again she said: Who would believe that Abraham should hear that Sara gave suck to a son, whom she bore to him in his old age.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the child grew and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast on the day of his weaning.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And when Sara had seen the son of Agar the Egyptian playing with Isaac her son, she said to Abraham:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Cast out this bondwoman, and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with my son Isaac.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Abraham took this grievously for his son.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And God said to him: Let it not seem grievous to thee for the boy, and for thy bondwoman: in all that Sara hath said to thee, hearken to her voice: for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But I will make the son also of the bondwoman a great nation, because he is thy seed.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So Abraham rose up in the morning, and taking bread and a bottle of water, put it upon her shoulder, and delivered the boy, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Bersabee.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And when the water in the bottle was spent, she cast the boy under one of the trees that were there.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And she went her way, and sat over against him a great way off as far as a bow can carry, for she said: I will not see the boy die: and sitting over against, she lifted up her voice and wept.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And God heard the voice of the boy: and an angel of God called to Agar from heaven, saying: What art thou doing, Agar? fear not: for God hath heard the voice of the boy, from the place wherein he is.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Arise, take up the boy, and hold him by the hand: for I will make him a great nation.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And God opened her eyes: and she saw a well of water, and went and filled the bottle, and gave the boy to drink.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And God was with him: and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became a young man, an archer.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he dwelt in the wilderness of Pharan, and his mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>At the same time Abimelech, and Phicol the general of his army said to Abraham: God is with thee in all that thou dost.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Swear therefore by God, that thou wilt not hurt me, nor my posterity, nor my stock: but according to the kindness that I have done to thee, thou shalt do to me, and to the land wherein thou hast lived a stranger.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Abraham said: I will swear.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And he reproved Abimelech for a well of water, which his servants had taken away by force.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Abimelech answered: I knew not who did this thing: and thou didst not tell me, and I heard not of it till today.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech: and both of them made a league.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs of the flock.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Abimelech said to him: What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set apart?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But he said: Thou shalt take seven ewe lambs at my hand: that they may be a testimony for me, that I dug this well.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Therefore that place was called Bersabee: because there both of them did swear.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And they made a league for the well of oath.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And Abimelech, and Phicol the general of his army arose and returned to the land of the Palestines. But Abraham planted a grove in Bersabee, and there called upon the name of the Lord God eternal.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And he was a sojourner in the land of the Palestines many days. </div><ul class='tnav'>
