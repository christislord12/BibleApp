<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 22</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>After these things, God tempted Abraham, and said to him: Abraham, Abraham. And he answered: Here I am.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>He said to him: Take thy only begotten son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and go into the land of vision: and there thou shalt offer him for an holocaust upon one of the mountains which I will show thee.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>So Abraham rising up in the night, saddled his ass: and took with him two young men, and Isaac his son: and when he had cut wood for the holocaust he went his way to the place which God had commanded him.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And on the third day, lifting up his eyes, he saw the place afar off.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And he said to his young men: Stay you here with the ass: I and the boy will go with speed as far as yonder, and after we have worshipped, will return to you.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And he took the wood for the holocaust, and laid it upon Isaac his son: and he himself carried in his hands fire and a sword. And as they two went on together,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Isaac said to his father: My father. And he answered: What wilt thou, son? Behold, saith he, fire and wood: where is the victim for the holocaust?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Abraham said: God will provide himself a victim for an holocaust, my son. So they went on together.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And they came to the place which God had shown him, where he built an altar, and laid the wood in order upon it: and when he had bound Isaac his son, he laid him on the altar upon the pile of wood.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And he put forth his hand and took the sword, to sacrifice his son.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And behold an angel of the Lord from heaven called to him, saying: Abraham, Abraham. And he answered: Here I am.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he said to him: Lay not thy hand upon the boy, neither do thou any thing to him: now I know that thou fearest God, and hast not spared thy only begotten son for my sake.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw behind his back a ram amongst the briers sticking fast by the horns, which he took and offered for a holocaust instead of his son.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he called the name of that place, The Lord seeth. Whereupon even to this day it is said: In the mountain the Lord will see.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from heaven, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>By my own self have I sworn, saith the Lord: because thou hast done this thing, and hast not spared thy only begotten son for my sake:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>I will bless thee, and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that is by the sea shore: thy seed shall possess the gates of their enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because thou hast obeyed my voice.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Abraham returned to his young men, and they went to Bersabee together, and he dwelt there.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>After these things, it was told Abraham that Melcha also had borne children to Nachor his brother.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Hus the firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Camuel the father of the Syrians,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Cased, and Azau, and Pheldas, and Jedlaph,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Bathuel, of whom was born Rebecca: These eight did Melcha bear to Nachor Abraham’s brother.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And his concubine, named Roma, bore Tabee, and Gaham, and Tahas, and Maacha. </div><ul class='tnav'>
