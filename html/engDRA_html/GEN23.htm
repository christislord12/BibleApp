And Ephron made answer to Abraham in the hearing of all that went in at the gate of the city, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Let it not be so, my lord, but do thou rather hearken to what I say: The field I deliver to thee, and the cave that is therein, in the presence of the children of my people, bury thy dead.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Abraham bowed down before the people of the land,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And he spoke to Ephron, in the presence of the people: I beseech thee to hear me: I will give money for the field: take it, and so I will bury my dead in it.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Ephron answered:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>My lord, hear me. The ground which thou desirest, is worth four hundred sicles of silver: this is the price between me and thee: but what is this? bury thy dead.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And when Abraham had heard this, he weighed out the money that Ephron had asked, in the hearing of the children of Heth, four hundred sicles of silver of common current money.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the field that before was Ephron’s, wherein was the double cave, looking towards Mambre, both it and the cave, and all the trees thereof in all its limits round about,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Was made sure to Abraham for a possession, in the sight of the children of Heth, and of all that went in at the gate of his city.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And so Abraham buried Sara his wife, in a double cave of the field, that looked towards Mambre, this is Hebron in the land of Chanaan.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the field was made sure to Abraham, and the cave that was in it, for a possession to bury in, by the children of Heth. </div><ul class='tnav'>
