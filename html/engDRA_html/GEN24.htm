And quickly she let down the pitcher upon her arm, and gave him drink.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And when he had drunk, she said: I will draw water for thy camels also, till they all drink.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And pouring out the pitcher into the troughs, she ran back to the well to draw water: and having drawn she gave to all the camels.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But he musing beheld her with silence, desirous to know whether the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And after that the camels had drunk, the man took out golden earrings, weighing two sicles: and as many bracelets of ten sicles weight.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he said to her: Whose daughter art thou? tell me: is there any place in thy father’s house to lodge?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And she answered: I am the daughter of Bathuel, the son of Melcha, whom she bore to Nachor.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And she said moreover to him: We have good store of both straw and hay, and a large place to lodge in.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>The man bowed himself down, and adored the Lord,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Saying: Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham, who hath not taken away his mercy and truth from my master, and hath brought me the straight way into the house of my master’s brother.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then the maid ran, and told in her mother’s house, all that she had heard.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Rebecca had a brother named Laban, who went out in haste to the man, to the well.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And when he had seen the earrings and bracelets in his sister’s hands, and had heard all that she related, saying: Thus and thus the man spoke to me: he came to the man who stood by the camels, and near to the spring of water,  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And said to him: Come in, thou blessed of the Lord: why standest thou without? I have prepared the house, and a place for the camels.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And he brought him in into his lodging: and he unharnessed the camels and gave straw and hay, and water to wash his feet, and the feet of the men that were come with him.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And bread was set before him. But he said: I will not eat, till I tell my message. He answered him: Speak.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And he said: I am the servant of Abraham:  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And the Lord hath blessed my master wonderfully, and he is become great: and he hath given him sheep and oxen, silver and gold, men servants and women servants, camels and asses.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And Sara my master’s wife hath borne my master a son in her old age, and he hath given him all that he had.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And my master made me swear, saying: Thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the Chanaanites, in whose land I dwell:  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>But thou shalt go to my father’s house, and shalt take a wife of my own kindred for my son:  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>But I answered my master: What if the woman will not come with me?  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>The Lord, said he, in whose sight I walk, will send his angel with thee, and will direct thy way: and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my own kindred, and of my father’s house.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>But thou shalt be clear from my curse, when thou shalt come to my kindred, if they will not give thee one.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And I came today to the well of water, and said: O Lord God of my master Abraham, if thou hast prospered my way, wherein I now walk,  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Behold I stand by the well of water, and the virgin, that shall come out to draw water, who shall hear me say: Give me a little water to drink of thy pitcher:  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And shall say to me: Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman, whom the Lord hath prepared for my master’s son.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And whilst I pondered these things secretly with myself, Rebecca appeared coming with a pitcher, which she carried on her shoulder: and she went down to the well and drew water. And I said to her: Give me a little to drink.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And she speedily let down the pitcher from her shoulder, and said to me: Both drink thou, and to thy camels I will give drink. I drank, and she watered the camels.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And I asked her, and said: Whose daughter art thou? And she answered: I am the daughter of Bathuel, the son of Nachor, whom Melcha bore to him. So I put earrings on her to adorn her face, and I put bracelets on her hands.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>And falling down I adored the Lord, blessing the Lord God of my master Abraham, who hath brought me the straight way to take the daughter of my master’s brother for his son.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Wherefore if you do according to mercy and truth with my master, tell me: but if it please you otherwise, tell me that also, that I may go to the right hand, or to the left.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>And Laban and Bathuel answered: The word hath proceeded from the Lord, we cannot speak any other thing to thee but his pleasure.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Behold Rebecca is before thee, take her and go thy way, and let her be the wife of thy master’s son, as the Lord hath spoken.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>Which when Abraham’s servant heard, falling down to the ground he adored the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>And bringing forth vessels of silver and gold, and garments, he gave them to Rebecca for a present. He offered gifts also to her brothers, and to her mother.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>And a banquet was made, and they ate and drank together, and lodged there. And in the morning, the servant arose, and said: Let me depart, that I may go to my master.  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>And her brother and mother answered: Let the maid stay at least ten days with us, and afterwards she shall depart.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>Stay me not, said he, because the Lord hath prospered my way: send me away, that I may go to my master.  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>And they said: Let us call the maid, and ask her will.  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>And they called her, and when she was come, they asked: Wilt thou go with this man? She said: I will go.  <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>So they sent her away, and her nurse, and Abraham’s servant, and his company,  <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>Wishing prosperity to their sister, and saying: Thou art our sister, mayst thou increase to thousands of thousands, and may thy seed possess the gates of their enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>So Rebecca and her maids, being set upon camels, followed the man: who with speed returned to his master.  <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>At the same time Isaac was walking along the way to the well which is called Of the living and the seeing: for he dwelt in the south country.  <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>And he was gone forth to meditate in the field, the day being now well spent: and when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw camels coming afar off.  <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#160;</span>Rebecca also, when she saw Isaac, lighted off the camel,  <span class="verse" id="V65">65&#160;</span>And said to the servant: Who is that man who cometh towards us along the field? And he said to her: That man is my master. But she quickly took her cloak, and covered herself.  <span class="verse" id="V66">66&#160;</span>And the servant told Isaac all that he had done.  <span class="verse" id="V67">67&#160;</span>Who brought her into the tent of Sara his mother, and took her to wife: and he loved her so much, that it moderated the sorrow which was occasioned by his mother’s death. </div><ul class='tnav'>
