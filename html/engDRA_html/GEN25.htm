<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 25</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And Abraham married another wife, named Cetura:  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Who bore him Zamran, and Jecsan, and Madan, and Madian, and Jesboc, and Sue.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Jecsan also begot Saba and Dadan. The children of Dadan were Assurim, and Latusim, and Loomin.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But of Madian was born Epha, and Opher, and Henoch, and Abida, and Eldaa: all these were the children of Cetura.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And Abraham gave all his possessions to Isaac.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And to the children of the concubines he gave gifts, and separated them from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, to the east country.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the days of Abraham’s life were a hundred and seventy-five years.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And decaying he died in a good old age, and having lived a long time, and being full of days: and was gathered to his people.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Isaac and Ismael his sons buried him in the double cave, which was situated in the field of Ephron the son of Seor the Hethite, over against Mambre;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Which he had bought of the children of Heth: there was he buried, and Sara his wife.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And after his death, God blessed Isaac his son, who dwelt by the well named Of the living and seeing.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>These are the generations of Ismael the son of Abraham, whom Agar the Egyptian, Sara’s servant, bore unto him:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And these are the names of his children according to their calling and generations. The firstborn of Ismael was Nabajoth, then Cedar, and Adbeel, and Mabsam.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Masma, and Duma, and Massa,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Hadar, and Thema, and Jethur, and Naphis, and Cedma.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>These are the sons of Ismael: and these are their names by their castles and towns, twelve princes of their tribes.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the years of Ismael’s life were a hundred and thirty-seven, and decaying he died, and was gathered unto his people.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he dwelt from Hevila as far as Sur, which looketh towards Egypt, to them that go towards the Assyrians. He died in the presence of all his brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>These also are the generations of Isaac the son of Abraham: Abraham begot Isaac:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Who when he was forty years old, took to wife Rebecca the daughter of Bathuel the Syrian of Mesopotamia, sister to Laban.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Isaac besought the Lord for his wife, because she was barren; and he heard him, and made Rebecca to conceive.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But the children struggled in her womb: and she said: If it were to be so with me, what need was there to conceive? And she went to consult the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he answering said: Two nations are in thy womb, and two peoples shall be divided out of thy womb, and one people shall overcome the other, and the elder shall serve the younger.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And when her time was come to be delivered, behold twins were found in her womb.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>He that came forth first was red, and hairy like a skin: and his name was called Esau. Immediately the other coming forth, held his brother’s foot in his hand, and therefore he was called Jacob.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Isaac was threescore years old when the children were born unto him.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And when they were grown up, Esau became a skillful hunter, and a husbandman, but Jacob a plain man dwelt in tents.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Isaac loved Esau, because he ate of his hunting: and Rebecca loved Jacob.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Jacob boiled pottage: to whom Esau, coming faint out of the field,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Said: Give me of this red pottage, for I am exceeding faint. For which reason his name was called Edom.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And Jacob said to him: Sell me thy first birthright.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>He answered: Lo I die, what will the first birthright avail me?  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Jacob said: Swear therefore to me. Esau swore to him, and sold his first birthright.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And so taking bread and the pottage of lentils, he ate, and drank, and went his way; making little account of having sold his first birthright. </div><ul class='tnav'>
