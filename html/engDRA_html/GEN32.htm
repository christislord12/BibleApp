<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 32</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Jacob also went on the journey he had begun: and the angels of God met him.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And when he saw them, he said: These are the camps of God, and he called the name of that place Mahanaim, that is, Camps.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And he sent messengers before him to Esau his brother to the land of Seir to the country of Edom:  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And he commanded them, saying: Thus shall ye speak to my lord Esau: Thus saith thy brother Jacob: I have sojourned with Laban, and have been with him until this day.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>I have oxen, and asses, and sheep, and menservants, and womenservants: and now I send a message to my lord, that I may find favour in thy sight.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying: We came to Esau thy brother, and behold he cometh with speed to meet thee with four hundred men.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then Jacob was greatly afraid; and in his fear divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and the sheep, and the oxen, and the camels, into two companies,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Saying: If Esau come to one company and destroy it, the other company that is left shall escape.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Jacob said: O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O Lord, who saidst to me: Return to thy land and to the place of thy birth, and I will do well for thee,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I am not worthy of the least of all thy mercies, and of thy truth which thou hast fulfilled to thy servant. With my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I return with two companies.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Deliver me from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am greatly afraid of him: lest perhaps he come, and kill the mother with the children.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Thou didst say that thou wouldst do well by me, and multiply my seed like the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And when he had slept there that night, he set apart, of the things which he had, presents for his brother Esau.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Two hundred she goats, twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and twenty bulls, twenty she asses, and ten of their foals.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And he sent them by the hands of his servants, every drove by itself, and he said to his servants: Go before me, and let there be a space between drove and drove.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he commanded the first, saying: If thou meet my brother Esau, and he ask thee: Whose art thou? or whither goest thou? or whose are these before thee?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Thou shalt answer: Thy servant Jacob’s: he hath sent them as a present to my lord Esau: and he cometh after us.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>In like manner he commanded the second and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying: Speak ye the same words to Esau, when ye find him.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And ye shall add: Thy servant Jacob himself also followeth after us: for he said: I will appease him with the presents that go before, and afterwards I will see him, perhaps he will be gracious to me.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>So the presents went before him, but himself lodged that night in the camp.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And rising early he took his two wives, and his two handmaids, with his eleven sons, and passed over the ford of Jaboc.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And when all things were brought over that belonged to him,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>He remained alone: and behold a man wrestled with him till morning.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And when he saw that he could not overcome him, he touched the sinew of his thigh, and forthwith it shrank.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And he said to him: Let me go, for it is break of day. He answered: I will not let thee go except thou bless me.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And he said: What is thy name? He answered: Jacob.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But he said: Thy name shall not be called Jacob, but Israel: for if thou hast been strong against God, how much more shalt thou prevail against men?  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Jacob asked him, Tell me by what name art thou called? He answered: Why dost thou ask my name? And he blessed him in the same place.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Jacob called the name of the place Phanuel, saying: I have seen God face to face, and my soul has been saved.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And immediately the sun rose upon him, after he was past Phanuel; but he halted on his foot.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Therefore the children of Israel, unto this day, eat not the sinew, that shrank in Jacob’s thigh: because he touched the sinew of his thigh and it shrank. </div><ul class='tnav'>
