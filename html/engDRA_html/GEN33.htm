<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 33</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And Jacob lifting up his eyes, saw Esau coming, and with him four hundred men: and he divided the children of Lia, and of Rachel, and of the two handmaids:  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And he put both the handmaids and their children foremost: and Lia and her children in the second place: and Rachel and Joseph last.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And he went forward and bowed down with his face to the ground seven times until his brother came near.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then Esau ran to meet his brother, and embraced him: and clasping him fast about the neck, and kissing him, wept.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And lifting up his eyes, he saw the women and their children, and said: What mean these? And do they belong to thee? He answered: They are the children which God hath given to me thy servant.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then the handmaids and their children came near, and bowed themselves.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Lia also with her children came near, and bowed down in like manner, and last of all Joseph and Rachel bowed down.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Esau said: What are the droves that I met? He answered: That I might find favour before my lord.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But he said: I have plenty, my brother, keep what is thine for thyself.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Jacob said: Do not so I beseech thee, but if I have found favour in thy eyes, receive a little present at my hands: for I have seen thy face, as if I should have seen the countenance of God: be gracious to me,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And take the blessing, which I have brought thee, and which God hath given me, who giveth all things. He took it with much ado at his brother’s earnest pressing him,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And said: Let us go on together, and I will accompany thee in thy journey.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Jacob said: My lord, thou knowest that I have with me tender children, and sheep, and kine with young: which if I should cause to be overdriven, in one day all the flocks will die.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>May it please my lord to go before his servant: and I will follow softly after him, as I shall see my children to be able, until I come to my lord in Seir.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Esau answered: I beseech thee, that some of the people at least, who are with me, may stay to accompany thee in the way. And he said: There is no necessity: I want nothing else but only to find favour, my lord, in thy sight.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So Esau returned, that day, the way that he came, to Seir.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Jacob came to Socoth: where having built a house, and pitched tents, he called the name of the place Socoth, that is, Tents.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he passed over to Salem, a city of the Sichemites, which is in the land of Chanaan, after he returned from Mesopotamia of Syria: and he dwelt by the town:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he bought that part of the field, in which he pitched his tents, of the children of Hemor, the father of Sichem for a hundred lambs.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And raising an altar there, he invoked upon it the most mighty God of Israel. </div><ul class='tnav'>
