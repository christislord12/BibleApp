and plundered the city in revenge of the rape.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And they took their sheep and their herds and their asses, wasting all they had in their houses and in the fields.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And their children and wives they took captive,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And when they had boldly perpetrated these things, Jacob said to Simeon and Levi: You have troubled me, and made me hateful to the Chanaanites and Pherezites, the inhabitants of this land: we are few: they will gather themselves together and kill me; and both I, and my house, shall be destroyed.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>They answered: Should they abuse our sister as a strumpet? </div><ul class='tnav'>
