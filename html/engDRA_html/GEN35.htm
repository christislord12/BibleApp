And he called him Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And said to him: I am God Almighty, increase thou and be multiplied. Nations and peoples of nations shall be from thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give to thee, and to thy seed after thee.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And he departed from him.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But he set up a monument of stone, in the place where God had spoken to him: pouring drink offerings upon it, and pouring oil thereon:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And calling the name of that place Bethel.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And going forth from thence, he came in the springtime to the land which leadeth to Ephrata: wherein when Rachel was in travail,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>By reason of her hard labour she began to be in danger, and the midwife said to her: Fear not, for thou shalt have this son also.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And when her soul was departing for pain, and death was now at hand, she called the name of her son Benoni, that is, The son of my pain: but his father called him Benjamin, that is, The son of the right hand.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>So Rachel died, and was buried in the highway that leadeth to Ephrata, this is Bethlehem.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Jacob erected a pillar over her sepulchre: this is the pillar of Rachel’s monument, to this day.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Departing thence, he pitched his tent beyond the Flock tower.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And when he dwelt in that country, Ruben went, and slept with Bala, the concubine of his father: which he was not ignorant of. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The sons of Lia: Ruben the first born, and Simeon, and Levi, and Juda, and Issachar, and Zabulon.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The sons of Bala, Rachel’s handmaid: Dan and Nephtali.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>The sons of Zelpha, Lia’s handmaid: Gad and Aser: these are the sons of Jacob, that were born to him in Mesopotamia of Syria.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And he came to Isaac his father in Mambre, the city of Arbee, this is Hebron: wherein Abraham and Isaac sojourned.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the days of Isaac were a hundred and eighty years.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And being spent with age he died, and was gathered to his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
