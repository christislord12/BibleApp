<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 37</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And Jacob dwelt in the land of Chanaan wherein his father sojourned.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And these are his generations: Joseph, when he was sixteen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren, being but a boy: and he was with the sons of Bala and of Zelpha his father’s wives: and he accused his brethren to his father of a most wicked crime.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Now Israel loved Joseph above all his sons, because he had him in his old age: and he made him a coat of divers colours.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And his brethren seeing that he was loved by his father, more than all his sons, hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Now it fell out also that he told his brethren a dream, that he had dreamed: which occasioned them to hate him the more.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And he said to them: Hear my dream which I dreamed.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I thought we were binding sheaves in the field: and my sheaf arose as it were, and stood, and your sheaves standing about, bowed down before my sheaf.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>His brethren answered: Shalt thou be our king? or shall we be subject to thy dominion? Therefore this matter of his dreams and words ministered nourishment to their envy and hatred.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>He dreamed also another dream, which he told his brethren, saying: I saw in a dream, as it were the sun, and the moon, and eleven stars worshipping me.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And when he had told this to his father and brethren, his father rebuked him, and said: What meaneth this dream that thou hast dreamed? shall I and thy mother, and thy brethren worship thee upon the earth?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>His brethren therefore envied him: but his father considered the thing with himself.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And when his brethren abode in Sichem feeding their father’s flocks,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Israel said to him: Thy brethren feed the sheep in Sichem: come, I will send thee to them. And when he answered:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I am ready: he said to him: Go, and see if all things be well with thy brethren, and the cattle: and bring me word again what is doing. So being sent from the vale of Hebron, he came to Sichem:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And a man found him there wandering in the field, and asked what he sought.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But he answered: I seek my brethren; tell me where they feed the flocks.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the man said to him: They are departed from this place: for I heard them say: Let us go to Dothain. And Joseph went forward after his brethren, and found them in Dothain.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And when they saw him afar off, before he came nigh them, they thought to kill him.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And said one to another: Behold the dreamer cometh.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Come, let us kill him, and cast him into some old pit: and we will say: Some evil beast hath devoured him: and then it shall appear what his dreams avail him:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Ruben hearing this, endeavoured to deliver him out of their hands, and said:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Do not take away his life, nor shed his blood: but cast him into this pit, that is in the wilderness, and keep your hands harmless: now he said this, being desirous to deliver him out of their hands and to restore him to his father.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And as soon as he came to his brethren, they forthwith stript him of his outside coat, that was of divers colours:  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And cast him into an old pit, where there was no water.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And sitting down to eat bread, they saw some Ismaelites on their way coming from Galaad, with their camels, carrying spices, and balm, and myrrh to Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Juda said to his brethren: What will it profit us to kill our brother, and conceal his blood?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>It is better that he be sold to the Ismaelites, and that our hands be not defiled: for he is our brother and our flesh. His brethren agreed to his words.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And when the Madianite merchants passed by, they drew him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ismaelites, for twenty pieces of silver: and they led him into Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Ruben, returning to the pit, found not the boy:  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And rending his garments he went to his brethren, and said: The boy doth not appear and whither shall I go?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And they took his coat, and dipped it in the blood of a kid, which they had killed:  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Sending some to carry it to their father, and to say: This we have found: see whether it be thy son’s coat, or not.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And the father acknowledging it, said: It is my son’s coat, an evil wild beast hath eaten him, a beast hath devoured Joseph.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And tearing his garments, he put on sackcloth, mourning for his son a long time.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And all his children being gathered together to comfort their father in his sorrow, he would not receive comfort, but said: I will go down to my son into hell, mourning. And whilst he continued weeping,  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>The Madianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Putiphar, an eunuch of Pharao, captain of the soldiers. </div><ul class='tnav'>
