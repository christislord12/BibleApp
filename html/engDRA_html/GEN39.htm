And Joseph was of a beautiful countenance, and comely to behold.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And after many days his mistress cast her eyes on Joseph, and said: Lie with me.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But he, in no wise consenting to that wicked act, said to her: Behold, my master hath delivered all things to me, and knoweth not what he hath in his own house:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Neither is there any thing which is not in my power, or that he hath not delivered to me, but thee, who art his wife: how then can I do this wicked thing, and sin against my God?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>With such words as these day by day, both the woman was importunate with the young man, and he refused the adultery.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Now it happened on a certain day, that Joseph went into the house, and was doing some business without any, man with him:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And she catching the skirt of his garment, said: Lie with me. But he leaving the garment in her hand, fled, and went out.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And when the woman saw the garment in her hands, and herself disregarded,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>She called to her the men of her house, and said to them: See, he hath brought in a Hebrew, to abuse us: he came in to me, to lie with me: and when I cried out,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he heard my voice, he left the garment that I held, and got him out.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For a proof therefore of her fidelity, she kept the garment, and shewed it to her husband when he returned home:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And said: The Hebrew servant, whom thou hast brought, came to me to abuse me.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And when he heard me cry, he left the garment which I held, and fled out.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>His master hearing these things, and giving too much credit to his wife’s words, was very angry.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And cast Joseph into the prison, where the king’s prisoners were kept, and he was there shut up.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But the Lord was with Joseph and having mercy upon him gave him favour in the sight of the chief keeper of the prison:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Who delivered into his hand all the prisoners that were kept in custody: and whatsoever was done was under him.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Neither did he himself know any thing, having committed all things to him: for the Lord was with him, and made all that he did to prosper. </div><ul class='tnav'>
