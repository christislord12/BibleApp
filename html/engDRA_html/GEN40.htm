<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 40</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>After this, it came to pass, that two eunuchs, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, offended their lord.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And Pharao being angry with them (now the one was chief butler, the other chief baker)  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>He sent them to the prison of the commander of the soldiers, in which Joseph also was prisoner,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But the keeper of the prison delivered them to Joseph, and he served them. Some little time passed, and they were kept in custody.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And they both dreamed a dream the same night, according to the interpretation agreeing to themselves:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And when Joseph was come in to them in the morning, and saw them sad,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>He asked them, saying: Why is your countenance sadder today than usual?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>They answered: We have dreamed a dream, and there is nobody to interpret it to us. And Joseph said to them: Doth not interpretation belong to God? Tell me what you have dreamed.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The chief butler first told his dream: I saw before me a vine,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>On which were three branches, which by little and little sent out buds, and after the blossoms brought forth ripe grapes:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the cup of Pharao was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into the cup which I held, and I gave the cup to Pharao.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Joseph answered: This is the interpretation of the dream: The three branches are yet three days:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>After which Pharao will remember thy service, and will restore thee to thy former place: and thou shalt present him the cup according to thy office, as before thou wast wont to do.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Only remember me, when it shall be well with thee, and do me this kindness: to put Pharao in mind to take me out of this prison:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews, and here without any fault was cast into the dungeon.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The chief baker seeing that he had wisely interpreted the dream, said: I also dreamed a dream, That I had three baskets of meal upon my head:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And that in one basket which was uppermost, I carried all meats that are made by the art of baking, and that the birds ate out of it.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Joseph answered: This is the interpretation of the dream: The three baskets are yet three days:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>After which Pharao will take thy head from thee, and hang thee on a cross, and the birds shall tear thy flesh.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The third day after this was the birthday of Pharao: and he made a great feast for his servants, and at the banquet remembered the chief butler, and the chief baker.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he restored the one to his place to present him the cup:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The other he hanged on a gibbet, that the truth of the interpreter might be shewn.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But the chief butler, when things prospered with him, forgot his interpreter. </div><ul class='tnav'>
