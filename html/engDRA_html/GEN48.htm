<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 48</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>After these things, it was told Joseph that his father was sick: and he set out to go to him, taking his two sons Manasses and Ephraim.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And it was told the old man: Behold thy son Joseph cometh to thee. And being strengthened he sat on his bed.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And when Joseph was come in to him, he said: God Almighty appeared to me at Luza, which is in the land of Chanaan: and he blessed me,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And he said: I will cause thee to increase and multiply, and I will make of thee a multitude of people: and I will give this land to thee, and to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>So thy two sons who were born to thee in the land of Egypt before I came hither to thee, shall be mine: Ephraim and Manasses shall be reputed to me as Ruben and Simeon.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But the rest whom thou shalt have after them, shall be thine, and shall be called by the name of their brethren in their possessions.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For, when I came out of Mesopotamia, Rachel died from me in the land of Chanaan in the very journey, and it was springtime: and I was going to Ephrata, and I buried her near the way of Ephrata, which by another name is called Bethlehem.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then seeing his sons, he said to him: Who are these?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>He answered: They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said: Bring them to me that I may bless them.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For Israel’s eyes were dim by reason of his great age, and he could not see clearly. And when they were brought to him, he kissed and embraced them.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And said to his son: I am not deprived of seeing thee: moreover God hath showed me thy seed.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And when Joseph had taken them from his father’s lap, he bowed down with his face to the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And he set Ephraim on his right hand, that is, towards the left hand of Israel; but Manasses on his left hand, to wit, towards his father’s right hand, and brought them near to him.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But he stretching forth his right hand, put it upon the head of Ephraim the younger brother; and the left upon the head of Manasses who was the elder, changing his hands.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Jacob blessed the sons of Joseph, and said: God, in whose sight my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, God that feedeth me from my youth until this day;  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The angel that delivereth me from all evils, bless these boys: and let my name be called upon them, and the names of my fathers Abraham, and Isaac, and may they grow into a multitude upon the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Joseph seeing that his father had put his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, was much displeased: and taking his father’s hand he tried to lift it from Ephraim’s head, and to remove it to the head of Manasses.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he said to his father: It should not be so, my father: for this is the firstborn, put thy right hand upon his head.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But he refusing, said: I know, my son, I know: and this also shall become peoples, and shall be multiplied: but this younger brother shall be greater than he: and his seed shall grow into nations.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he blessed them at that time, saying: In thee shall Israel be blessed, and it shall be said: God do to thee as to Ephraim, and as to Manasses. And he set Ephraim before Manasses.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he said to Joseph his son: Behold I die, and God will be with you, and will bring you back into the land of your fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>I give thee a portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorrhite with my sword and bow. </div><ul class='tnav'>
