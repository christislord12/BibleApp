He shall wash his robe in wine, and his garment in the blood of the grape.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>His eyes are more beautiful than wine, and his teeth whiter than milk.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Zabulon shall dwell on the sea shore, and in the road of ships, reaching as far as Sidon.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Issachar shall be a strong ass lying down between the borders.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He saw rest that it was good: and the land that it was excellent: and he bowed his shoulder to carry, and became a servant under tribute.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Dan shall judge his people like another tribe in Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Let Dan be a snake in the way, a serpent in the path, that biteth the horse’s heels that his rider may fall backward.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I will look for thy salvation, O Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Gad, being girded, shall fight before him: and he himself shall be girded backward.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Aser, his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield dainties to kings.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Nephtali, a hart let loose, and giving words of beauty.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Joseph is a growing son, a growing son and comely to behold; the daughters run to and fro upon the wall.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But they that held darts provoked him, and quarrelled with him, and envied him.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>His bow rested upon the strong, and the bands of his arms and his hands were loosed, by the hands of the mighty one of Jacob: thence he came forth a pastor, the stone of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The God of thy father shall be thy helper, and the Almighty shall bless thee with the blessings of heaven above, with the blessings of the deep that lieth beneath, with the blessings of the breasts and of the womb.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>The blessings of thy father are strengthened with the blessings of his fathers: until the desire of the everlasting hills should come; may they be upon the head of Joseph, and upon the crown of the Nazarite among his brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Benjamin a ravenous wolf, in the morning shall eat the prey, and in the evening shall divide the spoil.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: these things their father spoke to them, and he blessed every one, with their proper blessings.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And he charged them, saying: I am now going to be gathered to my people: bury me with my fathers in the double cave, which is in the field of Ephron the Hethite,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Over against Mambre in the land of Chanaan, which Abraham bought together with the field of Ephron the Hethite for a possession to bury in.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>There they buried him, and Sara his wife: there was Isaac buried with Rebecca his wife: there also Lia doth lie buried.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And when he had ended the commandments, wherewith he instructed his sons, he drew up his feet upon the bed, and died: and he was gathered to his people. </div><ul class='tnav'>
