O Lord, thy work, in the midst of the years bring it to life: In the midst of the years thou shalt make it known: when thou art angry, thou wilt remember mercy.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>God will come from the south, and the holy one from mount Pharan: His glory covered the heavens, and the earth is full of his praise.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>His brightness shall be as the light; horns are in his hands: There is his strength hid:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Death shall go before his face. And the devil shall go forth before his feet.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>He stood and measured the earth. He beheld, and melted the nations: and the ancient mountains were crushed to pieces. The hills of the world were bowed down by the journeys of his eternity.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I saw the tents of Ethiopia for their iniquity, the curtains of the land of Madian shall be troubled.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Wast thou angry, O Lord, with the rivers? or was thy wrath upon the rivers? or thy indignation in the sea? Who will ride upon thy horses: and thy chariots are salvation.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Thou wilt surely take up thy bow: according to the oaths which thou hast spoken to the tribes. Thou wilt divide the rivers of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The mountains saw thee, and were grieved: the great body of waters passed away. The deep put forth its voice: the deep lifted up its hands.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The sun and the moon stood still in their habitation, in the light of thy arrows, they shall go in the brightness of thy glittering spear.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>In thy anger thou wilt tread the earth under foot: in thy wrath thou wilt astonish the nations.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people: for salvation with thy Christ. Thou struckest the head of the house of the wicked: thou hast laid bare his foundation even to the neck.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Thou hast cursed his sceptres, the head of his warriors, them that came out as a whirlwind to scatter me. Their joy was like that of him that devoureth the poor man in secret.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Thou madest a way in the sea for thy horses, in the mud of many waters.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I have heard and my bowels were troubled: my lips trembled at the voice. Let rottenness enter into my bones, and swarm under me. That I may rest in the day of tribulation: that I may go up to our people that are girded.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For the fig tree shall not blossom: and there shall be no spring in the vines. The labour of the olive tree shall fail: and the fields shall yield no food: the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But I will rejoice in the Lord: and I will joy in God my Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The Lord God is my strength: and he will make my feet like the feet of harts: and he the conqueror will lead me upon my high places singing psalms. </div><ul class='tnav'>
