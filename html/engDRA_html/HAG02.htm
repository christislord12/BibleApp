And the priests answered, and said: No.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Aggeus said: If one that is unclean by occasion of a soul touch any of all these things, shall it be defiled? And the priests answered, and said: It shall be defiled.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Aggeus answered, and said: So is this people, and so is this nation before my face, saith the Lord, and so is all the work of their hands: and all that they have offered there, shall be defiled.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And now consider in your hearts, from this day and upward, before there was a stone laid upon a stone in the temple of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>When you went to a heap of twenty bushels, and they became ten: and you went into the press, to press out fifty vessels, and they became twenty.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I struck you with a blasting wind, and all the works of your hand with the mildew and with hail, yet there was none among you that returned to me, saith the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Set your hearts from this day, and henceforward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month: from the day that the foundations of the temple of the Lord were laid, and lay it up in your hearts.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Is the seed as yet sprung up? or hath the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree as yet flourished? from this day I will bless you.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the word of the Lord came a second time to Aggeus in the four and twentieth day of the month, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Speak to Zorobabel the governor of Juda, saying: I will move both heaven and earth.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and will destroy the strength of the kingdom of the Gentiles: and I will overthrow the chariot, and him that rideth therein: and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>In that day, saith the Lord of hosts, I will take thee, O Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, my servant, saith the Lord, and will make thee as a signet, for I have chosen thee, saith the Lord of hosts. </div><ul class='tnav'>
