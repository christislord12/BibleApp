And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And again, when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world, he saith: And let all the angels of God adore him.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And to the angels indeed he saith: He that maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But to the Son: Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of justice is the sceptre of thy kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Thou hast loved justice, and hated iniquity: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And: Thou in the beginning, O Lord, didst found the earth: and the works of thy hands are the heavens.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>They shall perish, but thou shalt continue: and they shall all grow old as a garment.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: but thou art the selfsame, and thy years shall not fail.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But to which of the angels said he at any time: Sit on my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy footstool?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Are they not all ministering spirits, sent to minister for them, who shall receive the inheritance of salvation? </div><ul class='tnav'>
