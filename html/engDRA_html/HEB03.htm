And they have not known my ways,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>As I have sworn in my wrath: If they shall enter into my rest.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Take heed, brethren, lest perhaps there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, to depart from the living God.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But exhort one another every day, whilst it is called today, that none of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For we are made partakers of Christ: yet so, if we hold the beginning of his substance firm unto the end.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>While it is said, Today if you shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in that provocation.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For some who heard did provoke: but not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And with whom was he offended forty years? Was it not with them that sinned, whose carcasses were overthrown in the desert?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And to whom did he swear, that they should not enter into his rest: but to them that were incredulous?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And we see that they could not enter in, because of unbelief. </div><ul class='tnav'>
