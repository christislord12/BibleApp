But the word of hearing did not profit them, not being mixed with faith of those things they heard.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For we, who have believed, shall enter into rest; as he said: As I have sworn in my wrath; If they shall enter into my rest; and this indeed when the works from the foundation of the world were finished.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For in a certain place he spoke of the seventh day thus: And God rested the seventh day from all his works.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And in this place again: If they shall enter into my rest.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Seeing then it remaineth that some are to enter into it, and they, to whom it was first preached, did not enter because of unbelief:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Again he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, Today, after so long a time, as it is above said: Today if you shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For if Jesus had given them rest, he would never have afterwards spoken of another day.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>There remaineth therefore a day of rest for the people of God.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For he that is entered into his rest, the same also hath rested from his works, as God did from his.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Let us hasten therefore to enter into that rest; lest any man fall into the same example of unbelief.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For the word of God is living and effectual, and more piercing than any two edged sword; and reaching unto the division of the soul and the spirit, of the joints also and the marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Neither is there any creature invisible in his sight: but all things are naked and open to his eyes, to whom our speech is.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Having therefore a great high priest that hath passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God: let us hold fast our confession.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For we have not a high priest, who can not have compassion on our infirmities: but one tempted in all things like as we are, without sin.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Let us go therefore with confidence to the throne of grace: that we may obtain mercy, and find grace in seasonable aid. </div><ul class='tnav'>
