For after that he said:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And this is the testament which I will make unto them after those days, saith the Lord. I will give my laws in their hearts, and on their minds will I write them:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And their sins and iniquities I will remember no more.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Now where there is a remission of these, there is no more an oblation for sin.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Having therefore, brethren, a confidence in the entering into the holies by the blood of Christ;  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>A new and living way which he hath dedicated for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And a high priest over the house of God:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Let us draw near with a true heart in fulness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with clean water.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering (for he is faithful that hath promised),  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And let us consider one another, to provoke unto charity and to good works:  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Not forsaking our assembly, as some are accustomed; but comforting one another, and so much the more as you see the day approaching.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For if we sin wilfully after having the knowledge of the truth, there is now left no sacrifice for sins,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But a certain dreadful expectation of judgment, and the rage of a fire which shall consume the adversaries.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>A man making void the law of Moses, dieth without any mercy under two or three witnesses:  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>How much more, do you think he deserveth worse punishments, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath esteemed the blood of the testament unclean, by which he was sanctified, and hath offered an affront to the Spirit of grace?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For we know him that hath said: Vengeance belongeth to me, and I will repay. And again: The Lord shall judge his people.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But call to mind the former days, wherein, being illuminated, you endured a great fight of afflictions.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And on the one hand indeed, by reproaches and tribulations, were made a gazingstock; and on the other, became companions of them that were used in such sort.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>For you both had compassion on them that were in bands, and took with joy the being stripped of your own goods, knowing that you have a better and a lasting substance.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Do not therefore lose your confidence, which hath a great reward.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>For patience is necessary for you; that, doing the will of God, you may receive the promise.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>For yet a little and a very little while, and he that is to come, will come, and will not delay.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>But my just man liveth by faith; but if he withdraw himself, he shall not please my soul.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>But we are not the children of withdrawing unto perdition, but of faith to the saving of the soul. </div><ul class='tnav'>
