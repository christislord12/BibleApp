<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 13</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Let the charity of the brotherhood abide in you.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And hospitality do not forget; for by this some, being not aware of it, have entertained angels.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Remember them that are in bands, as if you were bound with them; and them that labour, as being yourselves also in the body.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Marriage honourable in all, and the bed undefiled. For fornicators and adulterers God will judge.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Let your manners be without covetousness, contented with such things as you have; for he hath said: I will not leave thee, neither will I forsake thee.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>So that we may confidently say: The Lord is my helper: I will not fear what man shall do to me.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Remember your prelates who have spoken the word of God to you; whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Jesus Christ, yesterday, and today; and the same for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Be not led away with various and strange doctrines. For it is best that the heart be established with grace, not with meats; which have not profited those that walk in them.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>We have an altar, whereof they have no power to eat who serve the tabernacle.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the holies by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people by his own blood, suffered without the gate.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Let us go forth therefore to him without the camp, bearing his reproach.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For we have not here a lasting city, but we seek one that is to come.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise always to God, that is to say, the fruit of lips confessing to his name.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And do not forget to do good, and to impart; for by such sacrifices God’s favour is obtained.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Obey your prelates, and be subject to them. For they watch as being to render an account of your souls; that they may do this with joy, and not with grief. For this is not expedient for you.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Pray for us. For we trust we have a good conscience, being willing to behave ourselves well in all things.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And I beseech you the more to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And may the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great pastor of the sheep, our Lord Jesus Christ, in the blood of the everlasting testament,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Fit you in all goodness, that you may do his will; doing in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom is glory for ever and ever. Amen.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And I beseech you, brethren, that you suffer this word of consolation. For I have written to you in a few words.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty: with whom (if he come shortly) I will see you.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Salute all your prelates, and all the saints. The brethren from Italy salute you.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Grace be with you all. Amen. </div><ul class='tnav'>
