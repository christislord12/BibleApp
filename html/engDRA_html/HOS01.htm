And she conceived, and bore a son.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he said: Call his name, Not my people: for you are not my people, and I will not be yours.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, that is without measure, and shall not be numbered. And it shall be in the place where it shall be said to them: You are not my people: it shall be said to them: Ye are the sons of the living God.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the children of Juda, and the children of Israel shall be gathered together: and they shall appoint themselves one head, and shall come up out of the land: for great is the day of Jezrahel. </div><ul class='tnav'>
