We shall know, and we shall follow on, that we may know the Lord. His going forth is prepared as the morning light, and he will come to us as the early and the latter rain to the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>What shall I do to thee, O Ephraim? what shall I do to thee, O Juda? your mercy is as a morning cloud, and as the dew that goeth away in the morning.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For this reason have I hewed them by the prophets, I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments shall go forth as the light.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice: and the knowledge of God more than holocausts.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But they, like Adam, have transgressed the covenant, there have they dealt treacherously against me.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Galaad is a city of workers of idols, supplanted with blood.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And like the jaws of highway robbers, they conspire with the priests who murder in the way those that pass out Sichem: for they have wrought wickedness.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel: the fornications of Ephraim there: Israel is defiled.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And thou also, O Juda, set thee a harvest, when I shall bring back captivity of my people. </div><ul class='tnav'>
