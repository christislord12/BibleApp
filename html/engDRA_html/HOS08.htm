How long will they be incapable of being cleansed?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For itself also is the invention of Israel: a workman made it, and it is no god: for the calf of Samaria shall be turned to spiders’ webs.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For they shall sow wind, and reap a whirlwind, there is no standing stalk in it, the bud shall yield no meal; and if it should yield, strangers shall eat it.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Israel is swallowed up: now is he become among the nations like an unclean vessel.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath given gifts to his lovers.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But even though they shall have hired the nations, now will I gather them together: and they shall rest a while from the burden of the king, and the princes.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin: altars are become to him unto sin.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I shall write to him my manifold laws, which have been accounted as foreign.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>They shall offer victims, they shall sacrifice flesh, and shall eat it, and the Lord will not receive them: now will he remember their iniquity, and will visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and hath built temples: and Juda hath built many fenced cities: and I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the houses thereof. </div><ul class='tnav'>
