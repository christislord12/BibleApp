What wilt thou give them? Give them a womb without children, and dry breasts.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>All their wickedness is in Galgal, for there I hated them: for the wickedness of their devices I will cast them forth out of my house: I will love them no more, all their princes are revolters.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Ephraim is struck, their root is dried up, they shall yield no fruit. And if they should have issue, I will slay the best beloved fruit of their womb.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>My God will cast them away, because they hearkened not to him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations. </div><ul class='tnav'>
