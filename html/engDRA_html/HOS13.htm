I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy death; O hell, I will be thy bite: comfort is hidden from my eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Because he shall make a separation between brothers: the Lord will bring a burning wind that shall rise from the desert, and it shall dry up his springs, and shall make his fountain desolate, and he shall carry off the treasure of every desirable vessel. </div><ul class='tnav'>
