I will hear him, and I will make him flourish like a green fir tree: from me is thy fruit found.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and he shall know these things? for the ways of the Lord are right, and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall in them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
