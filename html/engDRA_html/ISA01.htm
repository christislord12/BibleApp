</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>The vision of Isaias the son of Amos I which he saw concerning Juda and Jerusalem in the days of Ozias, Joathan, Achaz, and Ezechias, kings of Juda.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Hear, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth, for the Lord hath spoken. I have brought up children, and exalted them: but they have despised me.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: but Israel hath not known me, and my people hath not understood.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Woe to the sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a wicked seed, ungracious children: they have forsaken the Lord, they have blasphemed the Holy One of Israel, they are gone away backwards.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For what shall I strike you any more, you that increase transgression? the whole head is sick, and the whole heart is sad.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>From the sole of the foot unto the top of the head, there is no soundness therein: wounds and bruises and swelling sores: they are not bound up, nor dressed, nor fomented with oil.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Your land is desolate, your cities are burnt with fire: your country strangers devour before your face, and it shall be desolate as when wasted by enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the daughter of Sion shall be left as a covert in a vineyard, and as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, and as a city that is laid waste.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Except the Lord of hosts had left us seed, we had been as Sodom, and we should have been like to Gomorrha.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodom, give ear to the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrha.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>To what purpose do you offer me the multitude of your victims, saith the Lord? I am full, I desire not holocausts of rams, and fat of fatlings, and blood of calves, and lambs, and buck goats.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>When you came to appear before me, who required these things at your hands, that you should walk in my courts?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Offer sacrifice no more in vain: incense is an abomination to me. The new moons, and the sabbaths, and other festivals I will not abide, your assemblies are wicked.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>My soul hateth your new moons, and your solemnities: they are become troublesome to me, I am weary of bearing them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And when you stretch forth your hands, I will turn away my eyes from you: and when you multiply prayer, I will not hear: for your hands are full of blood.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Wash yourselves, be clean, take away the evil of your devices from my eyes: cease to do perversely,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Learn to do well: seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge for the fatherless, defend the widow.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And then come, and accuse me, saith the Lord: if your sins be as scarlet, they shall be made as white as snow: and if they be red as crimson, they shall be white as wool.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>If you be willing, and will hearken to me, you shall eat the good things of the land.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But if you will not, and will provoke me to wrath: the sword shall devour you because the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>How is the faithful city, that was full of judgment, become a harlot? justice dwelt in it, but now murderers.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Thy silver is turned into dress: thy wine is mingled with water.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Thy princes are faithless, companions of thieves: they all love bribes, the run after rewards. They judge not for the fatherless: and the widow’s cometh not in to them.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Therefore saith the Lord the God of hosts, the mighty one of Israel: Ah! I will comfort myself over my adversaries: and I will be revenged of my enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And I will turn my hand to thee, and I will clean purge away thy dress, and I will take away all thy tin.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And I will restore thy judges as they were before, and thy counsellors as of old. After this thou shalt be called the city of the just, a faithful city.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Sion shall be redeemed in judgment, and they shall bring her back in justice.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And he shall destroy the wicked, and the sinners together: and they that have forsaken the Lord, shall be consumed.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For they shall be confounded for the idols, to which they have sacrificed: and you shall be ashamed of the gardens which you have chosen.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>When you shall be as an oak with the leaves falling off, and as a garden without water.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And your strength shall be as the ashes of tow, and your work as a spark: and both shall burn together, and there shall be none to quench it. </div><ul class='tnav'>
