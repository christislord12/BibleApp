Their land also is full of idols: they have adored the work of their own hands, which their own fingers have made.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And man hath bowed himself down, and man hath been debased: therefore forgive them not.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Enter thou into the rock, and hide thee in the pit from the face of the fear of the Lord, and from the glory of his majesty.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The lofty eyes of man are humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be made to stoop: and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Because the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and highminded, and upon every one that is arrogant, and he shall be humbled.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And upon all the tall and lofty cedars of Libanus, and upon all the oaks of Basan.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the elevated hills.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And upon every high tower, and every fenced wall.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And upon all the ships of Tharsis, and upon all that is fair to behold.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the loftiness of men shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be humbled, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And idols shall be utterly destroyed.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And they shall go into the holes of rocks, and into the caves of the earth from the face of the fear of the Lord, and from the glory of his majesty, when he shall rise up to strike the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>In that day a man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which he had made for himself to adore, moles and bats.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he shall go into the clefts of rocks, and into the holes of stones from the face of the fear of the Lord, and from the glory of his majesty, when he shall rise up to strike the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Cease ye therefore from the man, whose breath is in his nostrils, for he is reputed high. </div><ul class='tnav'>
