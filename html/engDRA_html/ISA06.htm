And I said: Lo, here am I, send me.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he said: Go, and thou shalt say to this people: Hearing, hear, and understand not: and see the vision, and know it not.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Blind the heart of this people, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes: lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted and I heal them.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And I said: How long, O Lord? And he said: Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land shall be left desolate.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the Lord shall remove men far away, and she shall be multiplied that was left in the midst of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And there shall be still a tithing therein, and she shall turn, and shall be made a show as a turpentine tree, and as an oak that spreadeth its branches: that which shall stand therein, shall be a holy seed. </div><ul class='tnav'>
