If you will not believe, you shall not continue.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the Lord spoke again to Achaz, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God either unto the depth of hell, or unto the height above.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Achaz said: I will not ask, and I will not tempt the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And he said: Hear ye therefore, O house of David: Is it a small thing for you to be grievous to men, that you are grievous to my God also?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign. Behold a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and his name shall be called Emmanuel.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He shall eat butter and honey, that he may know to refuse the evil, and to choose the good.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For before the child know to refuse the evil, and to choose the good, the land which thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of the face of her two kings.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The Lord shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon the house of thy father, days that have not come since the time of the separation of Ephraim from Juda with the king of the Assyrians.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall hiss for the fly, that is in the uttermost parts of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And they shall come, and shall all of them rest in the torrents of the valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all places set with shrubs, and in all hollow places.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>In that day the Lord shall shave with a razor that is hired by them that are beyond the river, by the king of the Assyrians, the head and the hairs of the feet, and the whole beard.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And for the abundance of milk he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that shall be left in the midst of the land.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place where there were a thousand vines, at a thousand pieces of silver, shall become thorns and briers.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>With arrows and with bows they shall go in thither: for briars and thorns shall be in all the land.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And as for all the hills that shall be raked with a rake, the fear of thorns and briers shall not come thither, but they shall be for the ox to feed on, and the lesser cattle to tread upon. </div><ul class='tnav'>
