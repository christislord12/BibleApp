They shall rejoice before thee, as they that rejoice in the harvest, as conquerors rejoice after taking a prey, when they divide the spoils.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For the yoke of their burden, and the rod of their shoulder, and the sceptre of their oppressor thou best overcome, as in the day of Median.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For every violent taking of spoils, with tumult, and garment mingled with blood, shall be burnt, and be fuel for the fire.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For a CHILD IS BORN to us, and a son is given to us, and the government is upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called, Wonderful, Counsellor, God the Mighty, the Father of the world to come, the Prince of Peace.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>His empire shall be multiplied, and there shall be no end of peace: he shall sit upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom; to establish it and strengthen it with judgment and with justice, from henceforth and for ever: the zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And all the people of Ephraim shall know, and the inhabitants of Samaria that say in the pride and haughtiness of their heart:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with square stones: they have cut down the sycamores, but we will change them for cedars.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the Lord shall set up the enemies of Rasin over him, and shall bring on his enemies in a crowd:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The Syrians from the east, and the Philistines from the west: and they shall devour Israel with open mouth, For all this his indignation is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the people are not returned to him who hath struck them, and have not sought after the Lord of hosts.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the Lord shall destroy out of Israel the head and the tail, him that bendeth down, and him that holdeth back, in one day.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The aged and honourable, he is the head: and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And they that call this people blessed, shall cause them to err: and they that are called blessed, shall be thrown down headlong.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Therefore the Lord shell have no joy in their young men: neither shall he have mercy on their fatherless, and widows: for every one is a hypocrite and wicked, and every mouth hath spoken folly. For all this his indignation is not turned away, but his bend is stretched out still.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For wickedness is kindled as a fire, it shall devour the brier and the thorn: and shall kindle in the thicket of the forest, and it shall be wrapped up in smoke ascending on high.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>By the wrath of the Lord of hosts the land is troubled, and the people shall be as fuel for the fire: no man shall spare his brother.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he shall turn to the right hand, and shall be hungry: and shall eat on the left hand, and shall not be filled: every one shell eat the flesh of his own arm: Manasses Ephraim, and Ephraim Manasses, and they together shall be against Juda.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>After all these things his indignation is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. </div><ul class='tnav'>
