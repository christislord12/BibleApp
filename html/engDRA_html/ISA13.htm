Gripings and pains shall take hold of them, they shall be in pain as a woman in labour. Every one shall be amazed at his neighbour, their countenances shall be as faces burnt.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Behold, the day of the Lord shall come, a cruel day, and full of indignation, and of wrath, and fury, to lay the land desolate, and to destroy the sinners thereof out of it.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For the stars of heaven, and their brightness shall not display their light: the sun shall be darkened in his rising, and the moon shall not shine with her light.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And I will visit the evils of the world, and against the wicked for their iniquity: and I will make the pride of infidels to cease, and will bring down the arrogancy of the mighty.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>A man shall be more precious than gold, yea a man than the finest of gold.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For this I will trouble the heaven: and the earth shall be moved out of her place, for the indignation of the Lord of hosts, and for the day of his tierce wrath.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And they shall be as a doe fleeing away, and as a sheep: and there shall be none to gather them together: every man shall turn to his own people, and every one shall flee to his own land.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Every one that shall be found, shall be slain: and every one that shall come to their aid, shall fall by the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Their infants shall be dashed in pieces before their eyes: their houses shall be pillaged, and their wives shall be ravished.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Behold I will stir up the Medes against them, who shall not seek silver, nor desire gold:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But with their arrows they shall kill the children, and shall have no pity upon the sucklings of the womb, and their eye shall not spare their sons.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And that Babylon, glorious among kingdoms, the famous pride of the Chaldeans, shall be even as the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrha.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>It shall no more be inhabited for ever, and it shall not be founded unto generation and generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch his tents there, nor shall shepherds rest there.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But wild beasts shall rest there, and their houses shall be filled with serpents, and ostriches shall dwell there, and the hairy ones shall dance there:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And owls shall answer one another there, in the houses thereof, and sirens in the temples of pleasure. </div><ul class='tnav'>
