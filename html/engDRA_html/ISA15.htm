For this shall the well appointed men of Moab howl, his soul shall howl to itself.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>My heart shall cry to Moab, the bars thereof shall flee unto Segor a heifer of three years old: for by the ascent of Luith they shall go up weeping: and in the way of Oronaim they shall lift up a cry of destruction.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For the waters of Nemrim shall be desolate, for the grass is withered away, the spring is faded, all the greenness is perished.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>According to the greatness of their work, is their visitation also: they shall lead them to the torrent of the willows.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For the cry is gone round about the border of Moab: the howling thereof unto Gallim, and unto the well of Elim the cry thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For the waters of Dibon are filled with blood: for I will bring more upon Dibon: the lion upon them that shall flee of Moab, and upon the remnant of the land. </div><ul class='tnav'>
