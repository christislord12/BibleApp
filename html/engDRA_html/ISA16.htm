He shall not tread out wine in the press that was wont to tread it out: the voice of the treaders I have taken away.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Wherefore my bowels shall sound like a harp for Moab, and my inward parts for the brick wall.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is wearied on his high places, that he shall go in to his sanctuaries to pray, and shall not prevail.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>This is the word, that the Lord spoke to Moab from that time:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And now the Lord hath spoken, saying: In three years, as the years of a hireling, the glory of Moab shall be taken away for all the multitude of the people, and it shall be left small and feeble, not many. </div><ul class='tnav'>
