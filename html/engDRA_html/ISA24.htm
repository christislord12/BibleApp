And I said: My secret to myself, my secret to myself, woe is me: the prevaricators have prevaricated, and with the prevarication of transgressors they have prevaricated.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Fear, and the pit, and the snare are upon thee, O thou inhabitant of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass, that he that shall flee from the noise of the fear, shall fall into the pit: and he that shall rid himself out of the pit, shall be taken in the snare: for the flood-gates from on high are opened, and the foundations of the earth shall be shaken.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>With breaking shall the earth be broken, with crushing shall the earth be crushed, with trembling shall the earth be moved.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>With shaking shall the earth be shaken as a drunken man, and shall be removed as the tent of one night: and the iniquity thereof shall be heavy upon it, and it shall fell, and not rise again.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass, that in that day the Lord shall visit upon the host of heaven on high, and upon the kings of the earth, on the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And they shall be gathered together as in the gathering of one bundle into the pit, and they shall be shut up there in prison: and after many days they shall be visited.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the moon shall blush, and the sun shall be ashamed, when the Lord of hosts shall reign in mount Sion, and in Jerusalem, and shall be glorified in the sight of his ancients. </div><ul class='tnav'>
