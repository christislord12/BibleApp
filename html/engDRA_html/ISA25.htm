For the blast of the mighty is like a whirlwind beating against a wall.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Thou shalt bring down the tumult of strangers, as heat in thirst: and as with heat under a burning cloud, thou shalt make the branch of the mighty to wither away.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the Lord of hosts shall make unto all people in this mountain, a feast of fat things, a feast of wine, of fat things full of marrow, of wine purified from the lees.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And he shall destroy in this mountain the face of the bond with which all people were tied, and the web that he began over all nations.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>He shall cast death down headlong for ever: and the Lord God shall wipe away tears from every face, and the reproach of his people he shall take away from off the whole earth: for the Lord hath spoken it.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And they shall say in that day: Lo, this is our God, we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the Lord, we have patiently waited for him, we shall rejoice and be joyfull in his salvation.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For the hand of the Lord shall rest in this mountain: and Moab shall be trodden down under him, as straw is broken in pieces with the wain.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And he shall stretch forth his hands under him, as he that swimmeth stretcheth forth his hands to swim: and he shall bring down his glory with the dashing of his hands.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the bulwarks of thy high walls shall fall, and be brought low, and shall be pulled down to the ground, even to the dust. </div><ul class='tnav'>
