When the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come upon us: for we have placed our hope in lies, and by falsehood we are protected.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Behold I will lay a stone in the foundations of Sion, a tried stone, a corner stone, a precious stone, founded in the foundation. He that believeth, let him not hasten.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And I will set judgment in weight, and justice in measure: and hail shall overturn the hope of falsehood: and waters shall overflow its protection.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Sour league with death shall be abolished, and your covenant with hell shall not stand: when the overflowing scourge shall pass, you shall be trodden down by it.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Whensoever it shall pass through, it shall take you away: because in the morning early it shall pass through, in the day and in the night, and vexation alone shall make you understand what you hear.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For the bed is straitened, so that one must fall out, and a short covering cannot cover both.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For the Lord shall stand up as in the mountain of divisions: he shall be angry as in the valley which is in Gabaon: that he may do his work, his strange work: that he may perform his work, his work is strange to him.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And now do not mock, lest your bonds be tied strait. For I have heard of the Lord the God of hosts a consumption and a cutting short upon all the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Give ear, and hear my voice, hearken, and hear my speech.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Shall the ploughman plough all the day to sow, shall he open and harrow his ground?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Will he not, when he hath made plain the surface thereof, sow gith, and scatter cummin, and put wheat in order, and barley, and millet, and vetches in their bounds?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For he will instruct him in judgment: his God will teach him.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For gith shall not be thrashed with saws, neither shall the cart wheel turn about upon cummin: but gith shall be beaten out with a rod, and cummin with a staff.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But bread corn shall be broken small: but the thrasher shall not thrash it for ever, neither shall the cart wheel hurt it, nor break it with its teeth.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>This also is come forth from the Lord God of hosts, to make his counsel wonderful, and magnify justice. </div><ul class='tnav'>
