A joy of wild asses, the pastures of flocks,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high: and the desert shall be as a charmel, and charmel shall be counted for a forest.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and justice shall sit in charmel.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the work of justice shall be peace, and the service of justice quietness, and security for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And my people shall sit in the beauty of peace, and in the tabernacles of confidence, and in wealthy rest.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But hail shall be in the descent of the forest, and the city shall be made very low.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Blessed are ye that sow upon all waters, sending thither the foot of the ox and the ass. </div><ul class='tnav'>
