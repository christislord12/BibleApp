Which of you can dwell with devouring fire? which of you shall dwell with everlasting burnings?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He that walketh in justices, and speaketh truth, that casteth away avarice by oppression, and shaketh his hands from all bribes, that stoppeth his ears lest he hear blood, and shutteth his eyes that he may see no evil.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He shall dwell on high, the fortifications of rocks shall be his highness: bread is given him, his waters are sure.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>His eyes shall see the king in his beauty, they shall see the land far off.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Thy heart shall meditate fear: where is the learned? where is he that pondereth the words of the law? where is the teacher of little ones?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The shameless people thou shalt not see, the people of profound speech: so that thou canst not understand the eloquence of his tongue, in whom there is no wisdom.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Look upon Sion the city of our solemnity: thy eyes shall see Jerusalem, a rich habitation, a tabernacle that cannot be removed: neither shall the nails thereof be taken away for ever, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Because only there our Lord is magnificent: it place of rivers, very broad and spacious streams: no ship with oars shall pass by it, neither shall the great galley pass through it.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is our king: he will save us.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Thy tacklings are loosed, and they shall be of no strength: thy mast shall be in such condition, that thou shalt not be able to spread the flag. Then shall the spoils of much prey be divided: the lame shall take the spoil.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Neither shall he that is near, say: I am feeble. The people that dwell therein, shall have their iniquity taken away from them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
