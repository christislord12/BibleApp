In the dens where dragons dwell before, shall rise up the verdure of the reed and the bulrush.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And a path and a way shall be there, and it shall be called the holy way: the unclean shall not pass over it, and this shall be unto you a straight way, so that fools shall not err therein.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>No lion shall be there, nor shall any mischievous beast go up by it, nor be found there: but they shall walk there that shall be delivered.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the redeemed of the Lord shall return, and shall come into Sion with praise, and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and mourning shall flee away. </div><ul class='tnav'>
