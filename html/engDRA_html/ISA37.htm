For he had heard that he was departed from Lachis.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he heard say about Tharaca the king of Ethiopia: He is come forth to fight against thee. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Ezechias, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Thus shall you speak to Ezechias the king of Juda, saying: Let not thy God deceive thee, in whom thou trustest, saying: Jerusalem shall not be given into the hands of the king of the Assyrians.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Behold thou hast heard all that the kings of the Assyrians hare done to all countries which they have destroyed, and canst thou be delivered?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Have the gods of the nations delivered them whom my fathers have destroyed, Gozam, and Haram, and Reseph, and the children of Eden, that were in Thalassar?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Where is the king of Emath, and the king of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Ana, and of Ava?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Ezechias took the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it, and went up to the house of the Lord, and Ezechias spread it before the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Ezechias prayed to the Lord, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, who sittest upon the cherubims, thou alone art the God of all the kingdoms of the earth, thou hast made heaven and earth.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Incline, O Lord, thy ear, and hear: open, O Lord, thy eyes, and see, and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which he hath sent to blaspheme the living God.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For of a truth, O Lord, the kings of the Assyrians have laid waste lands, and their countries.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And they have cast their gods into the fire, for they were not gods, but the works of men’s hands, of wood and stone: and they broke them in pieces.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And now, O Lord our God, save us out of his hand: and let all the kingdoms of the earth know, that thou only art the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Isaias the son of Amos sent to Ezechias, saying: Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: For the prayer thou hast made to me concerning Sennacherib the king of the Assyrians:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>This is the word which the Lord hath spoken of him: The virgin the daughter of Sion hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn: the daughter of Jerusalem hath wagged the head after thee.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Whom hast thou reproached, and whom hast thou blasphemed, and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thy eyes on high? Against the Holy One of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>By the hand of thy servants thou hast reproached the Lord: and hast said: With the multitude of my chariots I have gone up to the height of the mountains, to the top of Libanus: and I will out down its tall cedars, and its choice fir trees, and will enter to the top of its height, to the forest of its Carmel.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>I have digged, and drunk water, and have dried up with the sole of my foot, all the rivers shut up in banks.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Hast thou not heard what I have done to him of old? from the days of old I have formed it: and now I have brought it to effect: and it hath come to pass that hills fighting together, and fenced cities should be destroyed.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The inhabitants of them were weak of hand, they trembled, and were confounded: they became like the grass of the field, and the herb of the pasture, and like the grass of the housetops, which withered before it was ripe.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>I know thy dwelling, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>When thou wast mad against me, thy pride came up to my ears: therefore I will put a ring in thy nose, and a bit between thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But to thee this shall be a sign: Eat this year the things that spring of themselves, and in the second year eat fruits: but in the third year sow and reap, and giant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And that which shall be saved of the house of Juda, and which is left, shall take root downward, and shall bear fruit upward:  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a, remnant, and salvation from mount Sion: the zeal of the Lord of hosts shall do this.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Wherefore thus saith the Lord concerning the king of the Assyrians: He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow into it, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a trench about it.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>By the way that he came, he shall return, and into this city he shall not come, saith the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And I will protect this city, and will save it for my own sake, and for the sake of David my servant.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And the angel of the Lord went out, and slew in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand. And they arose in the morning, and behold they were all dead corpses.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And Sennacherib the king of the Assyrians went out and departed, and returned, and dwelt in Ninive.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the temple of Nesroch his god, that Adramelech and Sarasar his sons slew him with the sword: and they fled into the land of Ararat, and Asarhaddon his son reigned in his stead. </div><ul class='tnav'>
