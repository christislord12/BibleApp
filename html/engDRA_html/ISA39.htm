There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion that Ezechias shewed them not.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then Isaias the prophet came to king Ezechias, and said to him: What said these men, and from whence came they to thee? And Ezechias said: From a far country they came to me, from Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And he said: What saw they in thy house? And Ezechias said: All things that are in my house have they seen, there was not any thing which I have not shewn them in my treasures.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And Isaias said to Ezechias: Rear the word of the Lord of hosts.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Behold the days shall come, that all that is in thy house, and that thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried away into Babylon: there shall not any thing be left, saith the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And of thy children, that shall issue from thee, whom thou shalt beget, they shall take away, and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Ezechias said to Isaias: The word of the Lord, which he hath spoken, is good. And he said: Only let peace and truth be in my days. </div><ul class='tnav'>
