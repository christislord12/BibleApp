And I have given thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>That thou mightest open the eyes of the blind, and bring forth the prisoner out of prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I the Lord, this is my name: I will not give my glory to another, nor my praise to graven things.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The things that were first, behold they are come: and new things do I declare: before they spring forth, I will make you head them.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Sing ye to the Lora a new song, his praise is from the ends of the earth: you that go down to the sea, and all that are therein: ye islands, and ye inhabitants of them.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Let the desert and the cities thereof be exalted: Cedar shall dwell in houses: ye inhabitants of Petra, give praise, they shall cry from the top of the mountains.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>They shall give glory to the Lord, and shall declare his praise in the islands.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The Lord shall go forth as a mighty man, as a man of war shall he stir up zeal: he shall shout and cry: he shall prevail against his enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I have always held my peace, I have I kept silence, I have been patient, I will speak now as a woman in labour: I will destroy, and swallow up at once.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>I will lay waste the mountains and hills, and will make all their grass to wither: and I will turn rivers into islands, and will dry up the standing pools.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And I will lead the blind into the way which they know not: and in the paths which they were ignorant of I will make them walk: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight: these things have I done to them, and have not forsaken them.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>They are turned back: let them be greatly confounded, that trust in a graven thing, that say to a molten thing: You are our god.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Hear, ye deaf, and, ye blind, behold that you may see.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, but he to whom I have sent my messengers? Who is blind, but he that is sold? or who is blind, but the servant of the Lord?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Thou that seest many things, wilt thou not observe them? thou that hast ears open, wilt thou not hear?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the Lord was willing to sanctify him, and to magnify the law, and exalt it.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But this is a people that is robbed and wasted: they are all the snare of young men, and they are hid in the houses of prisons: they are made a prey, and there is none to deliver them: a spoil, and there is none that saith: Restore.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Who is there among you that will give ear to this, that will attend and hearken for times to come?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Who hath given Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to robbers? hath not the Lord himself, against whom we have sinned? And they would not walk in his ways, and they have not hearkened to his law.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And he hath poured out upon him the indignation of his fury, and a strong battle, and hath burnt him round about, and he knew not: and set him on fire, and he understood not. </div><ul class='tnav'>
