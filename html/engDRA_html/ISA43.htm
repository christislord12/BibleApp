Before me there was no God formed, and after me there shall be none.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I am, I am the Lord: and there is no saviour besides me.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I have declared, and have saved. I have made it heard, and there was no strange one among you. You are my witnesses, saith the Lord, and I am God.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And from the beginning I am the same, and there is none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall turn it away?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: For your sake I sent to Babylon, and have brought down all their bars, and the Chaldeans glorying in their ships.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>I am the Lord your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord, who made a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Who brought forth the chariot and the horse, the army and the strong: they lay down to sleep together, and they shall not rise again: they are broken as flax, and are extinct.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Remember not former things, and look not on things of old.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Behold I do new things, and now they shall spring forth, verily you shall know them: I will make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The beast of the field shall glorify me, the dragons and the ostriches: because I have given waters in the wilderness, rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, to my chosen.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>This people have I formed for myself, they shall shew forth my praise.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob, neither hast thou laboured about me, O Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Thou hast not offered me the ram of thy holocaust, nor hast thou glorified me with thy victims: I have not caused thee to serve with oblations, nor wearied thee with incense.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy victims. But thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thy iniquities.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>I am, I am he that blot out thy iniquities for my own sake, and I will not remember thy sins.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Put me in remembrance, and let us plead together: tell if thou hast any thing to justify thyself.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Thy brat father sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And I have profaned the holy princes, I have given Jacob to slaughter, and Israel to reproach. </div><ul class='tnav'>
