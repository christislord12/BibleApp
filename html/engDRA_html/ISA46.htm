Yea, when they shall cry also unto him, he shall not hear: he shall not save them from tribulation.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Remember this, and be ashamed: return, ye transgressors, to the heart.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Remember the former age, for I am God, and there is no God beside, neither is there the like to me:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Who shew from the beginning the things that shall be at last, and from ancient times the things that as yet are not done, saying: My counsel shall stand, and all my will shall be done:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Who call a bird from the east, and from a far country the man of my own will, and I have spoken, and will bring it to pass: I have created, and I will do it. Hear me, O ye hardhearted, who are far from justice.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I have brought my justice near, it shall not be afar off: and my salvation shall not tarry. I will give salvation in Sion, and my glory in Israel. </div><ul class='tnav'>
