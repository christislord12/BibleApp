All things are come upon thee, because of the multitude of thy sorceries, and for the great hardness of thy enchanters.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And thou best trusted in thy wickedness, and hast said: There is none that seeth me. Thy wisdom, and thy knowledge, this hath deceived thee. And thou best said in thy heart: I am, and besides me there is no other.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Evil shall come upon thee, and then shalt not know the rising thereof: and calamity shall fall violently upon thee, which thou canst not keep off: misery shall come upon thee suddenly, which thou shalt not know.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Stand now with thy enchanters, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, in which thou hast laboured from thy youth, if so be it may profit thee any thing, or if thou mayst become stronger.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Thou hast failed in the multitude or thy counsels: let now the astrologers stand and save thee, they that gazed at the stars, and counted the months, that from them they might tell the things that shall come to thee.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Behold they are as stubble, fire hath burnt them, they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the dames: there are no coals wherewith they may be warmed, nor fire, that they may sit thereat.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Such are all the things become to thee, in which thou best laboured: thy merchants from thy youth, every one hath erred in his own way, there is none that can save thee. </div><ul class='tnav'>
