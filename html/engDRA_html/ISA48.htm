I have shewn thee new things from that time, and things are kept which thou knowest not:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>They are created now, and not of old: and before the day, when thou heardest them not, lest thou shouldst say: Behold I knew them.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Thou hast neither heard, nor known, neither was thy ear opened of old. For I know that transgressing thou wilt transgress, and I have called thee a transgressor from the womb.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For my name’s sake I will remove my wrath far off: and for my praise I will bridle thee, lest thou shouldst perish.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Behold I have refined thee, but not as silver, I have chosen thee in the furnace of poverty.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For my own sake, for my own sake will I do it, that I may not be blasphemed: and I will not give my glory to another.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Hearken to me, O Jacob, and thou Israel whom I call: I am he, I am the first, and I am the last.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>My hand also hath founded the earth, and my right hand hath measured the heavens: I shall call them, and they shall stand together.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Assemble yourselves together, all you, and hear: who among them hath declared these things? the Lord hath loved him, he will do his pleasure in Babylon, and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>I, even I have spoken and called him: I have brought him, and his way is made prosperous.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Come ye near unto me, and hear this: I have not spoken in secret from the beginning: from the time before it was done, I was there, and now the Lord God hath sent me, and his spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord thy redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: I am the Lord thy God that teach thee profitable things, that govern thee in the way that thou walkest.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments: thy peace had been as a river, and thy justice as the waves of the sea,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And thy seed had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof: his name should not have perished, nor have been destroyed from before my face.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Come forth out of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, declare it with the voice of joy: make this to be heard, and speak it out even to the ends of the earth. Say: The Lord hath redeemed his servant Jacob.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>They thirsted not in the desert, when he led them out: he brought forth water out of the rock for them, and he clove the rock, and the waters gushed out.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>There is no peace to the wicked, saith the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
