Joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of praise.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Hearken unto me, O my people, and give ear to me, O my tribes: for a law shall go forth from me, and my judgment shall rest to be a light of the nations.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>My just one is near at hand, my saviour is gone forth, and my arms shall judge the people: the islands shall look for me, and shall patiently wait for my arm.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Lift up your eyes to heaven, and look down to the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish like smoke, and the earth shall be worn away like a garment, and the inhabitants thereof shall perish in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my justice shall not fail.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Hearken to me, you that know what is just, my people who have my law in your heart: fear ye not the reproach of men, and be not afraid of their blasphemies.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For the worm shall eat them up as a garment: and the moth shall consume them as wool: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my justice from generation to generation,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Arise, arise, put on strength, O thou arm of the Lord, arise as in the days of old, in the ancient generations. Hast not thou struck the proud one, and wounded the dragon?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Hast not thou dried up the sea, the water of the mighty deep, who madest the depth of the sea a way, that the delivered might pass over?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And now they that are redeemed by the Lord, shall return, and shall come into Sion singing praises, and joy everlasting shall be upon their heads, they shall obtain joy and gladness, sorrow and mourning shall flee away.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I, I myself will comfort you: who art thou, that thou shouldst be afraid of a mortal man, and of the son of man, who shall wither away like grass?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And thou hast forgotten the Lord thy maker, who stretched out the heavens, and founded the earth: and thee hast been afraid continually all the day at the presence of his fury who afflicted thee, and had prepared himself to destroy thee: where is now the fury of the oppressor?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He shall quickly come that is going to open unto you, and he shall not kill unto utter destruction, neither shall his bread fail.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But I am the Lord thy God, who trouble the sea, and the waves thereof swell: the Lord of hosts is my name.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I have put my words in thy mouth, and have protected thee in the shadow of my hand, that thou mightest plant the heavens, and found the earth: and mightest say to Sion: Thou art my people.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Arise, arise, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of the Lord the cup of his wrath; thou hast drunk even to the bottom of the cup of dead sleep, and thou hast drunk even to the dregs.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>There is none that can uphold her among all the children that she hath brought forth: and there is none that taketh her by the hand among all the children that she hath brought up.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>There are two things that have happened to thee: who shall be sorry for thee? desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the sword, who shall comfort thee?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Thy children are cast forth, they have slept at the head of all the ways, as the wild ox that is snared: full of the indignation of the Lord, of the rebuke of thy God.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Therefore hear this, thou poor little one, and thou that art drunk but no with wine.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Thus saith thy Sovereign the Lord and thy God, who will fight for his people: Behold I have taken out of thy hand the cup of dead sleep, the dregs of the cup of my indignation, thou shalt not drink it again any more.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And I will put it in the hand of them that have oppressed thee, and have said to thy soul: Bow down, that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as a way to them that went over. </div><ul class='tnav'>
