They that rule over them treat them unjustly, saith the Lord, and my name is continually blasphemed all the day long.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Therefore my people shall know my name in that day: for I myself that spoke, behold I am here.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, and that preacheth peace: of him that sheweth forth good, that preacheth salvation, that saith to Sion: Thy God shall reign!  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The voice of thy watchmen: they have lifted up their voice, they shall praise together: for they shall see eye to eye when the Lord shall convert Sion.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Rejoice, and give praise together, O ye deserts of Jerusalem: for the Lord hath comforted his people: he hath redeemed Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The Lord hath prepared his holy arm in the sight of all the Gentiles: and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Depart, depart, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean thing: go out of the midst of her, be ye clean, you that carry the vessels of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For you shall not go out in a tumult, neither shall you make haste by flight: For the Lord will go before you, and the God of Israel will gather you together.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Behold my servant shall understand, he shall be exalted, and extolled, and shall be exceeding high.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>As many have been astonished at thee, so shall his visage be inglorious among men, and his form among the sons of men.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He shall sprinkle many nations, kings shall shut their mouth at him: for they to whom it was not told of him, have seen: and they that heard not, have beheld. </div><ul class='tnav'>
