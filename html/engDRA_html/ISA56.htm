And let not the eunuch say: Behold I am a dry tree.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For thus saith the Lord to the eunuchs, They that shall keep my sabbaths, and shall choose the things that please me, and shall hold fast my covenant:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>I will give to them in my house, and within my walls, a place, and a name better than sons and daughters: I will give them an everlasting name which shall never perish.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the children of the stranger that adhere to the Lord, to worship him, and to love his name, to be his servants: every one that keepeth the sabbath from profaning it, and that holdeth fast my covenant:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I will bring them into my holy mount, and will make them joyful in my house of prayer: their holocausts, and their victims shall please me upon my altar: for my house shall be called the house of prayer, for all nations.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The Lord God, who gathereth the scattered of Israel, saith: I will still gather unto him his congregation.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>All ye beasts of the field come to devour, all ye beasts of the forest.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>His watchmen are all blind, they are all ignorant: dumb dogs not able to bark, seeing vain things, sleeping and loving dreams.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And meet impudent dogs, they never had enough: the shepherds themselves knew no understanding: all have turned aside into their own way, every one after his own gain, from the first even to the last.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Come, let us take wine, and be filled with drunkenness: and it shall be as today, so also tomorrow, and much more. </div><ul class='tnav'>
