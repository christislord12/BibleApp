Shall I not be angry at these things?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Upon a high and lofty mountain thou hast laid thy bed, and hast gone up thither to offer victims.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And behind the door, and behind the post thou best set up thy remembrance: for thou hast discovered thyself near me, and hast received an adulterer: thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made a covenant with them: thou hast loved their bed with open hand.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And thou hast adorned thyself for the king with ointment, and hast multiplied thy perfumes. Thou hast sent thy messengers far off, and wast debased even to hell.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Thou hast been wearied in the multitude of thy ways: yet thou saidst not: I will rest: thou hast found life of thy hand, therefore thou hast not asked.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For whom hast thou been solicitous and afraid, that thou hast lied, and hast not been mindful of me, nor thought on me in thy heart? for I am silent, and as one that seeth not, and thou hast forgotten me.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I will declare thy justice, and thy works shall not profit thee.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>When thou shalt cry, let thy companies deliver thee, but the wind shall carry them all off, a breeze shall take them away, but he that putteth his trust in me, shall inherit the land, and shall possess my holy mount.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And I will say: Make a way: give free passage, turn out of the path, take away the stumblingblocks out of the way of my people.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For thus saith the High and the Eminent that inhabiteth eternity: and his name is Holy, who dwelleth in the high and holy place, and with a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be angry unto the end: because the spirit shall go forth from my face, and breathings I will make.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For the iniquity of his covetousness I was angry, and I struck him: I hid my face from thee, and was angry: and he went away wandering in his own heart.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I saw his ways, and I healed him, and brought him back, and restored comforts to him, and to them that mourn for him.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>I created the fruit of the lips, peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near, said the Lord, and I healed him.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But the wicked are like the raging sea, which cannot rest, and the waves thereof cast up dirt and mire.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>There is no peace to the wicked, saith the Lord God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
