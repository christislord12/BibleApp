<div class='mt'>The Letter from James  
</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>James the servant of God, and of our Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>My brethren, count it all joy, when you shall fall into divers temptations;  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Knowing that the trying of your faith worketh patience.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And patience hath a perfect work; that you may be perfect and entire, failing in nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But if any of you want wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men abundantly, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, which is moved and carried about by the wind.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Therefore let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>A double minded man is inconstant in all his ways.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But let the brother of low condition glory in his exaltation:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the rich, in his being low; because as the flower of the grass shall he pass away.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For the sun rose with a burning heat, and parched the grass, and the flower thereof fell off, and the beauty of the shape thereof perished: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Blessed is the man that endureth temptation; for when he hath been proved, he shall receive a crown of life, which God hath promised to them that love him.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Let no man, when he is tempted, say that he is tempted by God. For God is not a tempter of evils, and he tempteth no man.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But every man is tempted by his own concupiscence, being drawn away and allured.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then when concupiscence hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin. But sin, when it is completed, begetteth death.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Do not err, therefore, my dearest brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Every best gift, and every perfect gift, is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no change, nor shadow of alteration.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For of his own will hath he begotten us by the word of truth, that we might be some beginning of his creatures.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>You know, my dearest brethren. And let every man be swift to hear, but slow to speak, and slow to anger.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For the anger of man worketh not the justice of God.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Wherefore casting away all uncleanness, and abundance of naughtiness, with meekness receive the ingrafted word, which is able to save your souls.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For if a man be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he shall be compared to a man beholding his own countenance in a glass.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For he beheld himself, and went his way, and presently forgot what manner of man he was.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But he that hath looked into the perfect law of liberty, and hath continued therein, not becoming a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work; this man shall be blessed in his deed.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And if any man think himself to be religious, not bridling his tongue, but deceiving his own heart, this man’s religion is vain.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Religion clean and undefiled before God and the Father, is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their tribulation: and to keep one’s self unspotted from this world. </div><ul class='tnav'>
