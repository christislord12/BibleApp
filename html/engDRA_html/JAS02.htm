Do not the rich oppress you by might? and do not they draw you before the judgment seats?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Do not they blaspheme the good name that is invoked upon you?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>If then you fulfill the royal law, according to the scriptures, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; you do well.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin, being reproved by the law as transgressors.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And whosoever shall keep the whole law, but offend in one point, is become guilty of all.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For he that said, Thou shalt not commit adultery, said also, Thou shalt not kill. Now if thou do not commit adultery, but shalt kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>So speak ye, and so do, as being to be judged by the law of liberty.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For judgment without mercy to him that hath not done mercy. And mercy exalteth itself above judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>What shall it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but hath not works? Shall faith be able to save him?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And if a brother or sister be naked, and want daily food:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And one of you say to them: Go in peace, be ye warmed and filled; yet give them not those things that are necessary for the body, what shall it profit?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So faith also, if it have not works, is dead in itself.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But some man will say: Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without works; and I will shew thee, by works, my faith.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Thou believest that there is one God. Thou dost well: the devils also believe and tremble.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Was not Abraham our father justified by works, offering up Isaac his son upon the altar?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Seest thou, that faith did co-operate with his works; and by works faith was made perfect?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the scripture was fulfilled, saying: Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him to justice, and he was called the friend of God.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Do you see that by works a man is justified; and not by faith only?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And in like manner also Rahab the harlot, was not she justified by works, receiving the messengers, and sending them out another way?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For even as the body without the spirit is dead; so also faith without works is dead. </div><ul class='tnav'>
