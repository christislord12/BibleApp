<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 5</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl in your miseries, which shall come upon you.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Your riches are corrupted: and your garments are motheaten.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Your gold and silver is cankered: and the rust of them shall be for a testimony against you, and shall eat your flesh like fire. You have stored up to yourselves wrath against the last days.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Behold the hire of the labourers, who have reaped down your fields, which by fraud has been kept back by you, crieth: and the cry of them hath entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>You have feasted upon earth: and in riotousness you have nourished your hearts, in the day of slaughter.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>You have condemned and put to death the Just One, and he resisted you not.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Be patient therefore, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth: patiently bearing till he receive the early and latter rain.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Be you therefore also patient, and strengthen your hearts: for the coming of the Lord is at hand.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Grudge not, brethren, one against another, that you may not be judged. Behold the judge standeth before the door.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Take, my brethren, for an example of suffering evil, of labour and patience, the prophets, who spoke in the name of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Behold, we account them blessed who have endured. You have heard of the patience of Job, and you have seen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is merciful and compassionate.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath. But let your speech be, yea, yea: no, no: that you fall not under judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Is any of you sad? Let him pray. Is he cheerful in mind? Let him sing.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Is any man sick among you? Let him bring in the priests of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the prayer of faith shall save the sick man: and the Lord shall raise him up: and if he be in sins, they shall be forgiven him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Confess therefore your sins one to another: and pray one for another, that you may be saved. For the continual prayer of a just man availeth much.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Elias was a man passible like unto us: and with prayer he prayed that it might not rain upon the earth, and it rained not for three years and six months.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he prayed again: and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>My brethren, if any of you err from the truth, and one convert him:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>He must know that he who causeth a sinner to be converted from the error of his way, shall save his soul from death, and shall cover a multitude of sins. </div><ul class='tnav'>
