They quickly forsook the way, in which their fathers had walked: and hearing the commandments of the Lord, they did all things contrary.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And when the Lord raised them up judges, in their days he was moved to mercy, and heard the groanings of the afflicted, and delivered them from the slaughter of the oppressors.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But after the judge was dead, they returned, and did much worse things than their fathers had done, following strange gods, serving them and adoring them. They left not their own inventions, and the stubborn way, by which they were accustomed to walk.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the wrath of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he said: Behold this nation hath made void my covenant, which I had made with their fathers, and hath despised to hearken to my voice:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>I also will not destroy the nations which Josue left, when he died:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>That through them I may try Israel, whether they will keep the way of the Lord, and walk in it, as their fathers kept it, or not.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The Lord therefore left all these nations, and would not quickly destroy them, neither did he deliver them into the hands of Josue. </div><ul class='tnav'>
