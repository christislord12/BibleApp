Debbora therefore arose, and went with Barac to Cedes.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And he called unto him Zabulon and Nepbtali, and went up with ten thousand fighting men, having Debbora in his company.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Now Haber the Cinite had some time before departed from the rest of the Cinites his brethren the sons of Hobab, the kinsman of Moses: and had pitched his tents unto the valley which is called Sellnim, and was near Cedes.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And it was told Sisara, that Barac the son of Ablinoem was gone up to mount Thabor:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And he gathered together his nine hundred chariots armed with scythes, and all his army from Haroseth of the Gentiles to the torrent Cison.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Debbora said to Barac: Arise, for this is the day wherein the Lord hath delivered Sisara into thy hands: behold he is thy leader. And Barac went down from mount Thabor, and ten thousand fighting men with him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the Lord struck a terror into Sisara, and all his chariots, and all his multitude, with the edge of the sword, at the sight of Barac, insomuch that Sisara leaping down from off his chariot, fled away on foot.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Barac pursued after the fleeing chariots and the army unto Haroseth of the Gentiles, and all the multitude of the enemies was utterly destroyed.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But Sisara fleeing came to the tent of Jahel the wife of Haber the Cinite, for there was peace between Jabin the king of Asor, and the house of Haber the Cinite.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Jahel went forth to meet Sisara, and said to him: Come in to me, my lord, come in, fear not. He went in to her tent, and being covered by her with a cloak,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Said to her: Give me, I beseech thee, a little water, for I am very thirsty. She opened a bottle of milk, and gave him to drink, and covered him.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Sisara said to her: Stand before the door of the tent, and when any shall come and inquire of thee, saying: Is there any man here? thou shalt say: There is none.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>So Jahel Haber’s wife took a nail of the tent, and taking also a hammer: and going in softly, and with silence, she put the nail upon the temples of his head, and striking it With the hammer, drove it through his brain fast into the ground: and so passing from deep sleep to death, he fainted away and died.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And behold Barac came pursuing after Sisara: and Jahel went out to meet him, and said to him: Come, and I will shew thee, the man whom thou seekest. And when he came into her tent, be saw Sisara lying dead, and the nail fastened in his temples.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>So God that day humbled Jabin the king of Chanaan before the children of Israel:  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Who grew daily stronger, and with a mighty hand overpowered Jabin king of Chanaan, till they quite destroyed him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
