But on the square of them, each side was extended the space of twenty feet.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And he made the gates thereof according to the height of the towers:  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And he gloried as a mighty one in the force of his army and in the glory of his chariots.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Now in the twelfth year of his reign, Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians, who reigned in Ninive the great city, fought against Arphaxad and overcame him,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>In the great plain which is called Ragua, about the Euphrates, and the Tigris, and the Jadason, in the plain of Erioch the king of the Elicians.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then was the kingdom of Nabuchodonosor exalted, and his heart was elevated: and he sent to all that dwelt in Cilicia and Damascus, and Libanus,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And to the nations that are in Carmelus, and Cedar, and to the inhabitants of Galilee in the great plain of Asdrelon,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And to all that were in Samaria, and beyond the river Jordan even to Jerusalem, and all the land of Jesse till you come to the borders of Ethiopia.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>To all these Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians, sent messengers:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But they all with one mind refused, and sent them back empty, and rejected them without honour.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then king Nabuchodonosor being angry against all that land, swore by his throne and kingdom that he would revenge himself of all those countries. </div><ul class='tnav'>
