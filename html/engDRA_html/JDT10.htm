And they brought her to the tent of Holofernes, telling him of her.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And when she was come into his presence, forthwith Holofernes was caught by his eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And his officers said to him: Who can despise the people of the Hebrews who have such beautiful women, that we should not think it worth our while for their sakes to fight against them?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Judith seeing Holofernes sitting under a canopy, which was woven of purple and gold, with emeralds and precious stones:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>After she had looked on his face bowed down to him, prostrating herself to the ground. And the servants of Holofernes lifted her up, by the command of their master. </div><ul class='tnav'>
