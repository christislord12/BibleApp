And when all had held their peace,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Judith said: Praise ye the Lord our God, who hath not forsaken them that hope in him.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And by me his handmaid he hath fulfilled his mercy, which he promised to the house of Israel: and he hath killed the enemy of his people by my hand this night.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then she brought forth the head of Holofernes out of the wallet, and shewed it them, saying: Behold the head of Holofernes the general of the army of the Assyrians, and behold his canopy, wherein he lay in his drunkenness, where the Lord our God slew him by the hand of a woman.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But as the same Lord liveth, his angel hath been my keeper both going hence, and abiding there, and returning from thence hither: and the Lord hath not suffered me his handmaid to be defiled, but hath brought me back to you without pollution of sin, rejoicing for his victory, for my escape, and for your deliverance.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Give all of you glory to him, because he is good, because his mercy endureth for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And they all adored the Lord, and said to her: The Lord hath blessed thee by his power, because by thee he hath brought our enemies to nought.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Ozias the prince of the people of Israel, said to her: Blessed art thou, O daughter, by the Lord the most high God, above all women upon the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Blessed be the Lord who made heaven and earth, who hath directed thee to the cutting off the head of the prince of our enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Because he hath so magnified thy name this day, that thy praise shall not depart out of the mouth of men who shall be mindful of the power of the Lord for ever, for that thou hast not spared thy life, by reason of the distress and tribulation of thy people, but hast prevented our ruin in the presence of our God.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And all the people said: So be it, so be it.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Achior being called for came, and Judith said to him: The God of Israel, to whom thou gavest testimony, that he revengeth himself of his enemies, he hath cut off the head of all the unbelievers this night by my hand.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And that thou mayst find that it is so, behold the head of Holofernes, who in the contempt of his pride despised the God of Israel: and threatened thee with death, saying: When the people of Israel shall be taken, I will command thy sides to be pierced with a sword.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Then Achior seeing the head of Holofernes, being seized with a great fear he fell on his face upon the earth, and his soul swooned away.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But after he had recovered his spirits he fell down at her feet, and reverenced her and said:  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Blessed art thou by thy God in every tabernacle of Jacob, for in every nation which shall hear thy name, the God of Israel shall be magnified on occasion of thee. </div><ul class='tnav'>
