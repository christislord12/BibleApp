And I said: I see a rod watching.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the Lord said to me: Thou hast seen well: for I will watch over my word to perform it.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the word of the Lord came to me a second time, saying: What seest thou? I see a boiling caldron, and the face thereof from the face of the north.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the Lord said to me: from the north shall an evil break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For behold I will call together all the families of the kingdoms of the north: saith the Lord: and they shall come, and shall set every one his throne in the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and upon all the walls thereof round about, and upon all the cities of Juda,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And I will pronounce my judgements against them, touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have sacrificed to strange gods, and have adored the work of their own hands.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak to them all that I command thee. Be not afraid at their presence: for I will make thee not to fear their countenance.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For behold I have made thee this day a fortified city, and a pillar of iron, and a wall of brass, over all the land, to the kings of Juda, to the princes thereof, and to the priests, and to the people of the land.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And they shall fight against thee, and shall not prevail: for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee. </div><ul class='tnav'>
