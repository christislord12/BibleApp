I have set the sand a bound for the sea, an everlasting ordinance, which it shall not pass over: and the waves thereof shall toss themselves, and shall not prevail: they shall swell, and shall not pass over it.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But the heart of this people is become hard of belief and provoking, they are revolted and gone away.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And they have not said in their heart: let us fear the Lord our God, who giveth us the early and the latter rain in due season: who preserveth for us the fullness of the yearly harvest.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Your iniquities have turned these things away, and your sins have withholden good things from you.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For among my people are found wicked men, that lie in wait as fowlers, setting snares and traps to catch men.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>As a net is full of birds, so their houses are full of deceit: therefore are they become great and enriched.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>They are grown gross and fat: and have most wickedly transgressed my words. They have not judged the cause of the widow, they have not managed the cause of the fatherless, they have not judged the judgement of the poor.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Shall I not visit for these things, saith the Lord? or shall not my soul take revenge on such a nation?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Astonishing and wonderful things have been done in the land.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The prophets prophesied falsehood, and the priests clapped their hands: and my people loved such things: what then shall be done in the end thereof? </div><ul class='tnav'>
