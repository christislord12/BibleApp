And they said: we will not walk.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And I appointed watchmen over you, saying: Hearken ye to the sound of the trumpet. And they said: We will not hearken.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what great things I will do to them.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Hear, O earth: Behold I will bring evils upon this people, the fruits of their own thoughts: because they have not heard my words, and they have cast away my law.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>To what purpose do you bring me frankincense from Saba, and the sweet smelling cane from a far country? your holocausts are not acceptable, nor are your sacrifices pleasing to me.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord: Behold, I will bring destruction upon this people, by which fathers and sons together shall fall, neighbor and kinsman shall perish.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord: Behold a people cometh from the land of the north, and a great nation shall rise up from the ends of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>They shall lay hold on arrow and shield: they are cruel, and will have no mercy. Their voice shall roar like the sea: and they shall mount upon horses, prepared as men for war, against thee, O daughter of Sion.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>We have heard the fame thereof, our hands grow feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, as a woman in labor.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Go not out into the fields, nor walk in the highway: for the sword of the enemy, and fear is on every side.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Gird thee with sackcloth, O daughter of my people, and sprinkle thee with ashes: make thee mourning as for an only son, a bitter lamentation, because the destroyer shall suddenly come upon us.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>I have set thee for a strong trier among my people: and thou shalt know and prove their way.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>All of these princes go out of the way, they walk deceitfully, they are brass and iron: they are all corrupted.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>The bellows have failed, the lead is consumed in the fire, the founder hath melted in vain: for their wicked deeds are not consumed.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Call them reprobate silver, for the Lord hath rejected them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
