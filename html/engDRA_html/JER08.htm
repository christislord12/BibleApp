They are all turned to their own course, as a horse rushing to the battle.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The kite in the air hath known her time: the turtle, and the swallow, and the stork have observed the time of their coming: but my people have not known the judgment of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>How do you say: We are wise, and the law of the Lord is with us? Indeed the lying pen of the scribes hath wrought falsehood.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The wise men are confounded, they are dismayed, and taken: for they have cast away the word of the Lord, and there is no wisdom in them.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Therefore I will give their women to strangers, their fields to others for an inheritance: because from the least even to the greatest all follow covetousness: from the prophet even to the priest, all deal deceitfully.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And they healed the breach of the daughter of my people disgracefully, saying Peace, peace: when there was no peace.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>They are confounded, because they have committed abomination: yea rather they are not confounded with confusion, and they have not know how to blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall; in the time of their visitation they shall fall, saith the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Gathering I will gather them together, saith the Lord, there is no grape on the vines, and there are no figs on the fig tree, the leaf is fallen: and I have given them the things that are passed away.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the fenced city, and let us be silent there: for the Lord our God hath put us to silence, and hath given us water of gall to drink: for we have sinned against the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>We looked for peace and no good came: for a time of healing, and behold fear.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The snorting of his horse was heard from Dan, all the land was moved at the sound of the neighing of his warriors: and they came and devoured the land, and all that was in it: the city and its inhabitants.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For behold I will send among you serpents, basilisks, against which there is no charm: and they shall bite you, saith the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>My sorrow is above sorrow, my heart mourneth within me.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Behold the voice of the daughter my people from a far country: Is not the Lord in Sion, or is not her king in her? why then have they provoked me to wrath with their idols, and strange vanities?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The harvest is passed, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For the affliction of the daughter of my people I am afflicted, and made sorrowful, astonishment hath taken hold on me.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Is there no balm in Galaad? or is no physician there? Why then is not the wound of the daughter of my people closed? </div><ul class='tnav'>
