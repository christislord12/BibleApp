Therefore, fear them not, for they can neither do evil nor good.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>There is none like to thee, O Lord: thou art great and great is thy name in might.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Who shall fear thee, O king of nations? for thine is the glory: among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms there is none like unto thee.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>They shall all proved together to be senseless and foolish: the doctrine of their vanity is wood.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Silver spread into plates is brought from Tharsis, and gold from Ophaz: the work of the artificer, and of the hand of the coppersmith: violet and purple is their clothing: all these things are the work of artificers.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But the Lord is the true God: he is the living God, and the everlasting king, at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his threatening.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Thus then shall you say to them: The gods that have not made heaven and earth, let them perish from the earth, and from among those places that are under heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>He that maketh the earth by his power, that prepareth the world by his wisdom, and stretcheth out the heavens by his knowledge.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>At his voice he giveth a multitude of waters in the heaven, and lifteth up the clouds from the ends of the earth: he maketh lightnings for rain, and bringeth for the wind out of his treasures.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Every man is become a fool for knowledge every artist is confounded in his graven idol: for what he hath cast is false, and there is no spirit in them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>They are vain things and a ridiculous work: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The portion of Jacob is not like these: for it is he who formed all things: and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: the Lord of hosts is his name.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Gather up thy shame out of the land, thou that dwellest in a siege.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For thus saith the Lord: Behold I will cast away far off the inhabitants of the land at this time: and I will afflict them, so that they may be found.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Woe is me for my destruction, my wound is very grievous. But I said: Truly this is my own evil, and I will bear it.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>My tabernacle is laid waste, all my cords are broken: my children are gone out from me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Because the pastors have done foolishly, and have not sought the Lord: therefore have they not understood, and all their flock is scattered.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Behold the sound of a noise cometh, a great commotion out of the land of the north: to make the cities of Juda a desert, and a dwelling for dragons.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>I know, O Lord, that the way of a man is not his: neither is it in a man to walk, and to direct his steps.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Correct me, O Lord, but yet with judgement: and not in fury, lest thou bring me to nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Pour out thy indignation upon the nations that have not known thee, and upon the provinces that have not called upon thy name: because they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have destroyed his glory. </div><ul class='tnav'>
