The beasts and the birds are consumed: because they have said: He shall not see our last end.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>If thou hast wearied with running with footmen, how canst thou contend with horses? and if thou hast been secure in a land of peace, what wilt thou do in the swelling of the Jordan?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have fought against thee, and have cried after thee with full voice: believe them not when they speak good things to thee.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I have forsaken my house, I have left my inheritance: I have given my dear soul into the land of her enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>My inheritance is become to me as a lion in the wood: is hath cried out against me, therefore have I hated it.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Is my inheritance to me as a speckled bird? Is it as a bird died throughout? come ye, assemble yourselves, all the beasts of the earth, make haste to devour.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot: they have changed my delightful portion into a desolate wilderness.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>They have laid it waste, and it hath mourned for me. With desolation is all the land made desolate; because there is none that considereth in the heart.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The spoilers are come upon all the ways of the wilderness, for the sword of the Lord shall devour from one end of the land to the other end thereof: there is no peace for all flesh.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>They have sown wheat, and reaped thorns: they have received an inheritance, and it shall not profit them: you shall be ashamed of your fruits, because of the fierce wrath of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord against all my wicked neighbors, that touch the inheritance that I have shared out to my people Israel: Behold I will pluck them out of their land, and I will pluck the house of Juda out of the midst of them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And when I shall have plucked them out, I will return, and have mercy on them: and I will bring them back, every man to his inheritance, and every man to his land.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass, if they will be taught, and will learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name: The Lord liveth, as they have taught my people to swear by baal: that they shall be built up in the midst of my people.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But if they will not hear, I will utterly pluck out and destroy that nation, saith the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
