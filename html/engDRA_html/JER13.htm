For the greatness of thy iniquity, thy nakedness is discovered, the soles of thy feet are defiled.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>If the Ethiopian can change his skin, or the leopard his spots: you may also do well, when you have learned evil.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And I will scatter them as stubble, which is carried away by the wind in the desert.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>This is thy lot, and the portion of thy measure from me, saith the Lord, because thou hast forgotten me, and hast trusted in falsehood.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Wherefore I have also bared my thighs against thy face, and thy shame hath appeared.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>I have seen thy adulteries, and thy neighing, the wickedness of thy fornication: and thy abominations, upon the hills in the field. Woe to thee, Jerusalem, wilt thou not be made clean after me: how long yet? </div><ul class='tnav'>
