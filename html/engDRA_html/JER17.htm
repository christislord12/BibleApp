And the leaf thereof shall be green, and in the time of drought it shall not be solicitous, neither shall it cease at any time to bring forth fruit.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The heart is perverse above all things, and unsearchable, who can know it?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I am the Lord who search the heart and prove the reins: who give to every one according to his way, and according to the fruit of his devices.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>As the partridge hath hatched eggs which she did not lay: so is he that hath gathered riches, and not by right: in the midst of his days he shall leave them, and in his latter end he shall be a fool.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>A high and glorious throne from the beginning is the place of our sanctification:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>O Lord the hope of Israel: all that forsake thee shall be confounded: they that depart from thee, shall be written in the earth: because they have forsaken the Lord, the vein of living waters.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be healed: save me, and I shall be saved, for thou art my praise.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Behold they say to me: Where is the word of the Lord? let it come.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And I am not troubled, following thee for my pastor, and I have not desired the day of man, thou knowest. That which went out of my lips, hath been right in thy sight.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Be not thou a terror unto me, thou art my hope in the day of affliction.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Let them be confounded that persecute me, and let not me be confounded: let them be afraid, and let not me be afraid: bring upon them the day of affliction, and with a double destruction, destroy them.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord to me: Go, and stand in the gate of the children of the people, by which the kings of Juda come in, and go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And thou shalt say to them: Hear the word of the Lord, ye kings of Juda, and all Juda, and all the inhabitant of Jerusalem, that enter in by these gates.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord: Take heed to your souls and carry no burdens on the Sabbath day: and bring them not in by the gates of Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And do not bring burdens out of your houses on the sabbath day, neither do ye any work: sanctify the sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But they did not hear, nor incline their ear: but hardened their neck, that they might not hear me, and might not receive instruction.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass: if you will hearken to me, saith the Lord, to bring in no burdens by the gates of this city on the sabbath day: and if you will sanctify the sabbath day, to do no work therein:  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then shall there enter in by the gates of this city kings and princes, sitting upon the throne of David, and riding in chariots and on horses, they and their princes, the men of Juda, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city shall be inhabited forever.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And they shall come from the cities of Juda, and from the places round about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plains, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing holocausts, and victims, and sacrifices, and frankincense, and they shall bring in an offering into the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But if you will not hearken to me, to sanctify the sabbath day, and not to carry burdens, and not to bring them in by the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day: I will kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the houses of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched. </div><ul class='tnav'>
