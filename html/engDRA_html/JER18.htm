Remember that I have stood in thy sight, so speak good for them, and turn away thy indignation from them.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Therefore deliver up their children to famine, and bring them into the hands of the sword: let their wives be bereaved of children and widows: and let their husbands be slain by death: let their young men be stabbed with the sword in battle.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Let a cry be heard out of their houses: for thou shalt bring the robber upon them suddenly: because they have digged a pit to take me, and have hid snares for my feet.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But thou, O Lord, knowest all their counsel against me unto death: forgive not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from thy sight: let them be overthrown before thy eyes, in the time of thy wrath do thou destroy them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
