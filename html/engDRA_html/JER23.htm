Who hath considered his word and heard it?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Behold the whirlwind of the Lord’s indignation shall come forth, and a tempest shall break out and come upon the head of the wicked.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The wrath of the Lord shall not return till he execute it, and till he accomplish the thought of his heart: in the latter days you shall understand his counsel.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>I did not send prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>If they stood in my counsel, and had made my words known to my people, I should have turned them from their evil way and from their wicked doings.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Am I, think ye, a God at hand, saith the Lord, and not a God afar off?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Shall a man be hid in secret places, and I not see him, saith the Lord? do not I fill heaven and earth, saith the Lord?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, and say: I have dreamed, I have dreamed.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies, and that prophesy the delusions of their own heart?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Who seek to make my people forget my name through their dreams, which they tell every man to his neighbor: as their fathers forgot my name for Baal.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream: and he that hath my word, let him speak my word with truth: what hath the chaff to do with the wheat, saith the Lord?  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Are not my words as a fire, saith the Lord: and as a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Therefore behold I am against the prophets, saith the Lord: who steal my words every one from his neighbor.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Behold I am against the prophets, saith the Lord: who use their tongues, and say: The Lord saith it.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Behold I am against the prophets that have lying dreams, saith the Lord: and tell them, and cause my people to err by their lying, and by their wonders: when I sent them not, nor commanded them, who have not profited this people at all, saith the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>If therefore this people, or the prophet, or the priest shall ask thee, saying: What is the burden of the Lord? thou shalt say to them: You are the burden: for I will cast you away, saith the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people that shall say: The burden of the Lord: I will visit upon that man, and upon his house.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Thus shall you say every one to his neighbor, and to his brother: What hath the Lord answered? and what hath the Lord spoken?  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And the burden of the Lord shall be mentioned no more, for every man’s word shall be his burden: for you have perverted the words of the living God, of the Lord of hosts our God.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Thus shalt thou say to the prophet: What hath the Lord answered thee? and what hath the Lord spoken?  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>But if you shall say: The burden of the Lord: therefore thus saith the Lord: Because you have said this word: The burden of the Lord: and I have sent to you saying: Say not, The burden of the Lord:  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Therefore behold I will take you away carrying you, and will forsake you, and the city which I gave to you, and to your fathers, out of my presence.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame which shall never be forgotten. </div><ul class='tnav'>
