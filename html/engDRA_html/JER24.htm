And I said: Figs, the good figs, very good: and the bad figs, very bad, which cannot be eaten because they are bad.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so will I regard the captives of Juda, whom I have sent forth out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans, for their own good.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And I will set my eyes upon them to be pacified, and I will bring them again into this land: and I will be their God: and I will build them up, and not pull them down: and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And I will give them a heart to know me, that I am the Lord: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: because they shall return to me with their whole heart.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And as the very bad figs, that cannot be eaten, because they are bad: thus saith the Lord: So will I give Sedecias the king of Juda, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that have remained in this city, and that dwell in the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And I will deliver them up to vexation, and affliction, to all the kingdoms of the earth: to be a reproach, and a byword, and a proverb, and to be a curse in all places, to which I have cast them out.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And I will send among them the sword, and the famine, and the pestilence: till they be consumed out of the land which I gave to them, and their fathers. </div><ul class='tnav'>
