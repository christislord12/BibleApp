And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, after that Hananias the prophet had broken the chain from off the neck of Jeremias the prophet, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Go, and tell Hananias: Thus saith the Lord: Thou hast broken chains of wood, and thou shalt make for them chains of iron.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, to serve Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and they shall serve him: moreover also I have given him the beasts of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Jeremias the prophet said to Hananias the prophet: Hear now, Hananias: the Lord hath not sent thee, and thou hast made this people to trust in a lie.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord: Behold I will send thee away from off the face of the earth: this year shalt thou die: for thou hast spoken against the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Hananias the prophet died in that year, in the seventh month. </div><ul class='tnav'>
