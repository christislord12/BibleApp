Because they have called thee, O Sion, an outcast: This is she that hath none to seek after her.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord: Behold I bring back the captivity of the pavilions of Jacob, and will have pity on his houses, and the city shall be built in her place, and the temple shall be found according to the order thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And out of them shall come forth praise, and the voice of them that play: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be made few: and I will glorify them, and they shall not be lessened.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And their children shall be as from the beginning, and their assembly be permanent before me: and I will against all that afflict them.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And their leader shall be of themselves: and their prince shall come forth from the midst of them: and I will bring him near, and he shall come to me: for who is this that setteth his heart to approach to me, saith the Lord?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And you shall be my people: and I will be your God.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Behold the whirlwind of the Lord, his fury going forth, a violent storm, it shall rest upon the head of the wicked.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The Lord will not turn away the wrath of his indignation, till he have executed and performed the thought o his heart: in the latter days you shall understand these things. </div><ul class='tnav'>
