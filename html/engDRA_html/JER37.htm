And the army of Pharao was come out of Egypt: and the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem, hearing these tidings, departed from Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias the prophet, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: Thus shall you say to the king of Juda, who sent you to inquire of me: Behold the army of Pharao, which is come forth to help you, shall return into their own land, into Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord: Deceive not your souls, saying: The Chaldeans shall surely depart and go away from us: for they shall not go away;  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But if you should even beat all the army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there should be left of them some wounded men: they shall rise up, every man from his tent, and burn this city with Are.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Now when the army of the Chaldeans was gone away from Jerusalem, because of Pharao’s army,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Jeremias went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin: and to divide a possession there in the presence of the citizens.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And when he was come to the gate of Benjamin, the captain of the gate, who I was there in his turn, was one named Jerias, the son of Selemias, the son of Hananias: and he took hold of Jeremias the prophet, saying: Thou art fleeing to the Chaldeans.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Jeremias answered: It is not so, I am not fleeing to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Jerias took Jeremias and brought him to the princes.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Wherefore the princes were angry with Jeremias, and they beat him, and cast him into the prison that was in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for he was chief over the prison.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So Jeremias went into the house of the prison, and into the dungeon: and Jeremias remained there many days.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then Sedecias the king, sending, took him: and asked him secretly in his house, and said: Is there, thinkest thou, any word from the Lord? And Jeremias said: There is. And he said: Thou shalt be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Jeremias said to king Sedecias: In what have I offended against thee, or thy servants, or thy people, that thou hast cast me into prison?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Where are your prophets that prophesied to you, and said: The king of Babylon shall not come against you, and against this land?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Now therefore hear, I beseech thee, my lord the king: let my petition be accepted in thy sight: and send me not back into the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then king Sedecias commanded that Jeremias should be committed into the entry of the prison: and that they should give him daily a piece of bread, beside broth, till all the bread in the city were spent: and Jeremias remained in the entry of the prison. </div><ul class='tnav'>
