<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 41</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ismahel the son of Nathanias, the son of Elisama of the royal blood, and the nobles of the king, and ten men with him, came to Godolias the son of Ahicam into Masphath: and they ate bread there together in Masphath.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And Ismahel the son of Nathanias arose, and the ten men that were with him, and they struck Godolias the son of Ahicam, the son of Saphan with the sword, and slew him whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Ismahel slew also all the Jews that were with Godolias in Masphath, and the Chaldeans that were found there, and the soldiers.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And on the second day after he had killed Godolias, no man yet knowing it,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>There came some from Sichem, and from Silo, and from Samaria, fourscore men, with their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and mourning: and they had offerings and incense in their hand, to offer in the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Ismahel the son of Nathanias went forth from Masphath to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and when he had met them, he said to them: Come to Godolias, the son of Ahicam.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And when they were come to the midst of the city, Ismahel the son of Nathanias, slew them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, he and the men that were with him.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But ten men were found among them, that said to Ismahel: Kill us not: for we have stores in the field, of wheat, and barley, and oil, and honey. And he forbore, and slew them not with their brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the pit into which Ismahel cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he slew because of Godolias, is the same that king Asa made, for fear of Baasa the king of Israel: the same did Ismahel the son of Nathanias fill with them that were slain.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then Ismahel carried away captive all the remnant of the people that were in Masphath: the king’s daughters, and all the people that remained in Masphath: whom Nabuzardan the general of the army had committed to Godolias the son of Ahicam. And Ismahel the son of Nathanias took them, and he departed, to go over to the children of Ammon.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But Johanan the son of Caree, and all the captains of the fighting men that were with him, heard of the evil that Ismahel the son of Nathanias had done.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And taking all the men, they went out to fight against Ismahel the son of Nathanias, and they found him by the great waters that are in Gabaon.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And when all the people that were with Ismahel, had seen Johanan the son of Caree, and all the captains of the fighting men that were with him, they rejoiced.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And all the people whom Ismahel had taken, went back to Masphath: and they returned and went to Johanan the son of Caree.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But Ismahel the son of Nathanias fled with eight men, from the face of Johanan, and went to the children of Ammon.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then Johanan the son of Caree, and all the captains of the soldiers that were with him, took all the remnant of the people whom they had recovered from Ismahel the son of Nathanias, from Masphath, after that he had slain Godolias the son of Ahicam: valiant men for war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gabaon:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And they departed, and sat as sojourners in Chamaam, which is near Bethlehem: in order to go forward, and enter into Egypt,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>From the face of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because Ismahel the son of Nathanias had slain Godolias the son of Ahicam, whom the king of Babylon had made governor in the land of Juda. </div><ul class='tnav'>
