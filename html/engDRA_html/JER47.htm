The fathers have not looked back to the children, for feebleness of hands,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Because of the coming of the day, in which all the Philistines shall be laid waste, and Tyre and Sidon shall be destroyed, with all the rest of their helpers. For the Lord hath wasted the Philistines, the remnant of the isle of Cappadocia.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Baldness is come upon Gaza: Ascalon hath held her peace with the remnant of their valley: how long shalt thou cut thyself?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>O thou sword of the Lord, how long wilt thou not be quiet? Go into thy scabbard, rest, and be still.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>How shall it be quiet, when the Lord hath given it a charge against Ascalon, and against the countries thereof by the sea side, and there hath made an appointment for it? </div><ul class='tnav'>
