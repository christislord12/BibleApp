The same of the second pillar, and the pomegranates.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And there were ninety-six pomegranates hanging down: and the pomegranates being a hundred in all, were compassed with network.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the general took Saraias the chief priest, and Sophonias the second priest, and the three keepers of the entry.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>He also took out of the city one eunuch that was chief over the men of war: and seven men of them that were near the king’s person, that were found in the city: and a scribe, an officer of the army who exercised the young soldiers: and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Nabuzardan the general took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon, to Reblatha.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the king of Babylon struck them, and put them to death in Reblatha, in the land of Emath: and Juda was carried away captive out of his land.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>This is the people whom Nabuchodonosor carried away captive: in the seventh year, three thousand and twenty-three Jews.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>In the eighteenth year of Nabuchodonosor, eight hundred and thirty-two souls from Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>In the three and twentieth year of Nabuchodonosor, Nabuzardan the general carried away of the Jews seven hundred and forty-five souls. So all the souls were four thousand six hundred.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Joachin king of Juda, in the twelfth month, the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the head of Joachin king of Juda, and brought him forth out of prison.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And he spoke kindly to him, and he set his throne above the thrones of the kings that were with him in Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And he changed his prison garments, and he ate bread before him always all the days of his life.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And for his diet a continual provision was allowed him by the king of Babylon, every day a portion, until the day of his death, all the days of his life. </div><ul class='tnav'>
