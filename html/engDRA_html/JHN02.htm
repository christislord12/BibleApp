And they filled them up to the brim.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Jesus saith to them: Draw out now, and carry to the chief steward of the feast. And they carried it.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And when the chief steward had tasted the water made wine, and knew not whence it was, but the waiters knew who had drawn the water; the chief steward calleth the bridegroom,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And saith to him: Every man at first setteth forth good wine, and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse. But thou hast kept the good wine until now.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee; and manifested his glory, and his disciples believed in him.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>After this he went down to Capharnaum, he and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they remained there not many days.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the pasch of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he found in the temple them that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And when he had made, as it were, a scourge of little cords, he drove them all out of the temple, the sheep also and the oxen, and the money of the changers he poured out, and the tables he overthrew.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And to them that sold doves he said: Take these things hence, and make not the house of my Father a house of traffic.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And his disciples remembered, that it was written: The zeal of thy house hath eaten me up.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The Jews, therefore, answered, and said to him: What sign dost thou shew unto us, seeing thou dost these things?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Jesus answered, and said to them: Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The Jews then said: Six and forty years was this temple in building; and wilt thou raise it up in three days?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But he spoke of the temple of his body.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>When therefore he was risen again from the dead, his disciples remembered, that he had said this, and they believed the scripture, and the word that Jesus had said.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Now when he was at Jerusalem, at the pasch, upon the festival day, many believed in his name, seeing his signs which he did.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But Jesus did not trust himself unto them, for that he knew all men,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And because he needed not that any should give testimony of man: for he knew what was in man. </div><ul class='tnav'>
