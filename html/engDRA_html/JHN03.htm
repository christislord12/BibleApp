But he that doth not believe, is already judged: because he believeth not in the name of the only begotten Son of God.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And this is the judgment: because the light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than the light: for their works were evil.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For every one that doth evil hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, that his works may not be reproved.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But he that doth truth, cometh to the light, that his works may be made manifest, because they are done in God.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>After these things Jesus and his disciples came into the land of Judea: and there he abode with them, and baptized.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And John also was baptizing in Ennon near Salim; because there was much water there; and they came and were baptized.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For John was not yet cast into prison.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And there arose a question between some of John’s disciples and the Jews concerning purification:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And they came to John, and said to him: Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou gavest testimony, behold he baptizeth, and all men come to him.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>John answered, and said: A man cannot receive any thing, unless it be given him from heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>You yourselves do bear me witness, that I said, I am not Christ, but that I am sent before him.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>He that hath the bride, is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth with joy because of the bridegroom’s voice. This my joy therefore is fulfilled.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>He must increase, but I must decrease.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>He that cometh from above, is above all. He that is of the earth, of the earth he is, and of the earth he speaketh. He that cometh from heaven, is above all.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth: and no man receiveth his testimony.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>He that hath received his testimony, hath set to his seal that God is true.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>For he whom God hath sent, speaketh the words of God: for God doth not give the Spirit by measure.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>The Father loveth the Son: and he hath given all things into his hand.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>He that believeth in the Son, hath life everlasting; but he that believeth not the Son, shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
