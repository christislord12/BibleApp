<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 4</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>When Jesus therefore understood that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus maketh more disciples, and baptizeth more than John,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>(Though Jesus himself did not baptize, but his disciples,)  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>He left Judea, and went again into Galilee.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And he was of necessity to pass through Samaria.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>He cometh therefore to a city of Samaria, which is called Sichar, near the land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well. It was about the sixth hour.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>There cometh a woman of Samaria, to draw water. Jesus saith to her: Give me to drink.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For his disciples were gone into the city to buy meats.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then that Samaritan woman saith to him: How dost thou, being a Jew, ask of me to drink, who am a Samaritan woman? For the Jews do not communicate with the Samaritans.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Jesus answered, and said to her: If thou didst know the gift of God, and who he is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou perhaps wouldst have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The woman saith to him: Sir, thou hast nothing wherein to draw, and the well is deep; from whence then hast thou living water?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Jesus answered, and said to her: Whosoever drinketh of this water, shall thirst again; but he that shall drink of the water that I will give him, shall not thirst for ever:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But the water that I will give him, shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up into life everlasting.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The woman saith to him: Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come hither to draw.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Jesus saith to her: Go, call thy husband, and come hither.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The woman answered, and said: I have no husband. Jesus said to her: Thou hast said well, I have no husband:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For thou hast had five husbands: and he whom thou now hast, is not thy husband. This thou hast said truly.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The woman saith to him: Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Our fathers adored on this mountain, and you say, that at Jerusalem is the place where men must adore.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Jesus saith to her: Woman, believe me, that the hour cometh, when you shall neither on this mountain, not in Jerusalem, adore the Father.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>You adore that which you know not: we adore that which we know; for salvation is of the Jews.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true adorers shall adore the Father in spirit and in truth. For the Father also seeketh such to adore him.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>God is a spirit; and they that adore him, must adore him in spirit and in truth.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The woman saith to him: I know that the Messias cometh (who is called Christ). Therefore, when he is come, he will tell us all things.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Jesus saith to her: I am he, who am speaking with thee.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And immediately his disciples came; and they wondered that he talked with the woman. Yet no man said: What seekest thou? or, why talkest thou with her?  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>The woman therefore left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men there:  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Come, and see a man who has told me all things whatsoever I have done. Is not he the Christ?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>They went therefore out of the city, and came unto him.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>In the mean time the disciples prayed him, saying: Rabbi, eat.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But he said to them: I have meat to eat, which you know not.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>The disciples therefore said one to another: Hath any man brought him to eat?  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Jesus saith to them: My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, that I may perfect his work.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Do you not say, There are yet four months, and then the harvest cometh? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes, and see the countries; for they are white already to harvest.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life everlasting: that both he that soweth, and he that reapeth, may rejoice together.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>For in this is the saying true: That it is one man that soweth, and it is another that reapeth.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>I have sent you to reap that in which you did not labour: others have laboured, and you have entered into their labours.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Now of that city many of the Samaritans believed in him, for the word of the woman giving testimony: He told me all things whatsoever I have done.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>So when the Samaritans were come to him, they desired that he would tarry there. And he abode there two days.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And many more believed in him because of his own word.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And they said to the woman: We now believe, not for thy saying: for we ourselves have heard him, and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Now after two days, he departed thence, and went into Galilee.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>For Jesus himself gave testimony that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And when he was come into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things he had done at Jerusalem on the festival day; for they also went to the festival day.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>He came again therefore into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain ruler, whose son was sick at Capharnaum.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>He having heard that Jesus was come from Judea into Galilee, went to him, and prayed him to come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Jesus therefore said to him: Unless you see signs and wonders, you believe not.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>The ruler saith to him: Lord, come down before that my son die.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Jesus saith to him: Go thy way; thy son liveth. The man believed the word which Jesus said to him, and went his way.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>And as he was going down, his servants met him; and they brought word, saying, that his son lived.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>He asked therefore of them the hour wherein he grew better. And they said to him: Yesterday, at the seventh hour, the fever left him.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>The father therefore knew, that it was at the same hour that Jesus said to him, Thy son liveth; and himself believed, and his whole house.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judea into Galilee. </div><ul class='tnav'>
