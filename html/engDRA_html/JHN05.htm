<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 5</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>After these things was a festival day of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Now there is at Jerusalem a pond, called Probatica, which in Hebrew is named Bethsaida, having five porches.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>In these lay a great multitude of sick, of blind, of lame, of withered; waiting for the moving of the water.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And an angel of the Lord descended at certain times into the pond; and the water was moved. And he that went down first into the pond after the motion of the water, was made whole, of whatsoever infirmity he lay under.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And there was a certain man there, that had been eight and thirty years under his infirmity.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Him when Jesus had seen lying, and knew that he had been now a long time, he saith to him: Wilt thou be made whole?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The infirm man answered him: Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pond. For whilst I am coming, another goeth down before me.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Jesus saith to him: Arise, take up thy bed, and walk.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And immediately the man was made whole: and he took up his bed, and walked. And it was the sabbath that day.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The Jews therefore said to him that was healed: It is the sabbath; it is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>He answered them: He that made me whole, he said to me, Take up thy bed, and walk.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>They asked him therefore: Who is that man who said to thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But he who was healed, knew not who it was; for Jesus went aside from the multitude standing in the place.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Afterwards, Jesus findeth him in the temple, and saith to him: Behold thou art made whole: sin no more, lest some worse thing happen to thee.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The man went his way, and told the Jews, that it was Jesus who had made him whole.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, because he did these things on the sabbath.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But Jesus answered them: My Father worketh until now; and I work.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Hereupon therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he did not only break the sabbath, but also said God was his Father, making himself equal to God.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then Jesus answered, and said to them: Amen, amen, I say unto you, the Son cannot do any thing of himself, but what he seeth the Father doing: for what things soever he doth, these the Son also doth in like manner.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things which himself doth: and greater works than these will he shew him, that you may wonder.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and giveth life: so the Son also giveth life to whom he will.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For neither doth the Father judge any man, but hath given all judgment to the Son.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>That all men may honour the Son, as they honour the Father. He who honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father, who hath sent him.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Amen, amen I say unto you, that he who heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath life everlasting; and cometh not into judgment, but is passed from death to life.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Amen, amen I say unto you, that the hour cometh, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For as the Father hath life in himself, so he hath given the Son also to have life in himself:  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And he hath given him power to do judgment, because he is the Son of man.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Wonder not at this; for the hour cometh, wherein all that are in the graves shall hear the voice of the Son of God.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And they that have done good things, shall come forth unto the resurrection of life; but they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>I cannot of myself do any thing. As I hear, so I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of him that sent me.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>You sent to John, and he gave testimony to the truth.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But I receive not testimony from man: but I say these things, that you may be saved.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>He was a burning and a shining light: and you were willing for a time to rejoice in his light.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>But I have a greater testimony than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to perfect; the works themselves, which I do, give testimony of me, that the Father hath sent me.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And the Father himself who hath sent me, hath given testimony of me: neither have you heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And you have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him you believe not.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Search the scriptures, for you think in them to have life everlasting; and the same are they that give testimony of me.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And you will not come to me that you may have life.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>I receive glory not from men.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>But I know you, that you have not the love of God in you.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>I am come in the name of my Father, and you receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him you will receive.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>How can you believe, who receive glory one from another: and the glory which is from God alone, you do not seek?  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Think not that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one that accuseth you, Moses, in whom you trust.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>For if you did believe Moses, you would perhaps believe me also; for he wrote of me.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words? </div><ul class='tnav'>
