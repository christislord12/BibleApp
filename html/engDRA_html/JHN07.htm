<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 7</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>After these things Jesus walked in Galilee; for he would not walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Now the Jews’ feast of tabernacles was at hand.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And his brethren said to him: Pass from hence, and go into Judea; that thy disciples also may see thy works which thou dost.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For there is no man that doth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, manifest thyself to the world.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For neither did his brethren believe in him.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then Jesus said to them: My time is not yet come; but your time is always ready.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth: because I give testimony of it, that the works thereof are evil.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Go you up to this festival day, but I go not up to this festival day: because my time is not accomplished.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>When he had said these things, he himself stayed in Galilee.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But after his brethren were gone up, then he also went up to the feast, not openly, but, as it were, in secret.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The Jews therefore sought him on the festival day, and said: Where is he?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And there was much murmuring among the multitude concerning him. For some said: He is a good man. And others said: No, but he seduceth the people.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Yet no man spoke openly of him, for fear of the Jews.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Now about the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the Jews wondered, saying: How doth this man know letters, having never learned?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Jesus answered them, and said: My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>If any man do the will of him; he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>He that speaketh of himself, seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, he is true, and there is no injustice in him.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Did Moses not give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Why seek you to kill me? The multitude answered, and said: Thou hast a devil; who seeketh to kill thee?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Jesus answered, and said to them: One work I have done; and you all wonder:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Therefore, Moses gave you circumcision (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and on the sabbath day you circumcise a man.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>If a man receive circumcision on the sabbath day, that the law of Moses may not be broken; are you angry at me because I have healed the whole man on the sabbath day?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Judge not according to the appearance, but judge just judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Some therefore of Jerusalem said: Is not this he whom they seek to kill?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And behold, he speaketh openly, and they say nothing to him. Have the rulers known for a truth, that this is the Christ?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But we know this man, whence he is: but when the Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching, and saying: You both know me, and you know whence I am: and I am not come of myself; but he that sent me, is true, whom you know not.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>I know him, because I am from him, and he hath sent me.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>They sought therefore to apprehend him: and no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>But of the people many believed in him, and said: When the Christ cometh, shall he do more miracles, than these which this man doth?  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>The Pharisees heard the people murmuring these things concerning him: and the rulers and Pharisees sent ministers to apprehend him.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Jesus therefore said to them: Yet a little while I am with you: and then I go to him that sent me.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>You shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither you cannot come.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>The Jews therefore said among themselves: Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>What is this saying that he hath said: You shall seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, you cannot come?  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And on the last, and great day of the festivity, Jesus stood and cried, saying: If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>He that believeth in me, as the scripture saith, Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Now this he said of the Spirit which they should receive, who believed in him: for as yet the Spirit was not given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Of that multitude therefore, when they had heard these words of his, some said: This is the prophet indeed.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Others said: This is the Christ. But some said: Doth the Christ come out of Galilee?  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Doth not the scripture say: That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem the town where David was?  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>So there arose a dissension among the people because of him.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And some of them would have apprehended him: but no man laid hands on him.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>The ministers therefore came to the chief priests and the Pharisees. And they said to them: Why have you not brought him?  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>The ministers answered: Never did man speak like this man.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>The Pharisees therefore answered them: Are you also seduced?  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Hath any one of the rulers believed in him, or of the Pharisees?  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>But this multitude, that knoweth not the law, are accursed.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Nicodemus said to them, (he that came to him by night, who was one of them:)  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Doth our law judge any man, unless it first hear him, and know what he doth?  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>They answered, and said to him: Art thou also a Galilean? Search the scriptures, and see, that out of Galilee a prophet riseth not.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>And every man returned to his own house. </div><ul class='tnav'>
