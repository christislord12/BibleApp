<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 8</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And Jesus went unto mount Olivet.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him, and sitting down he taught them.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And the scribes and the Pharisees bring unto him a woman taken in adultery: and they set her in the midst,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And said to him: Master, this woman was even now taken in adultery.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Now Moses in the law commanded us to stone such a one. But what sayest thou?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And this they said tempting him, that they might accuse him. But Jesus bowing himself down, wrote with his finger on the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>When therefore they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said to them: He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And again stooping down, he wrote on the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But they hearing this, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest. And Jesus alone remained, and the woman standing in the midst.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then Jesus lifting up himself, said to her: Woman, where are they that accused thee? Hath no man condemned thee?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Who said: No man, Lord. And Jesus said: Neither will I condemn thee. Go, and now sin no more.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Again therefore, Jesus spoke to them, saying: I am the light of the world: he that followeth me, walketh not in darkness, but shall have the light of life.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The Pharisees therefore said to him: Thou givest testimony of thyself: thy testimony is not true.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Jesus answered, and said to them: Although I give testimony of myself, my testimony is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go: but you know not whence I come, or whither I go.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>You judge according to the flesh: I judge not any man.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And if I do judge, my judgment is true: because I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And in your law it is written, that the testimony of two men is true.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I am one that give testimony of myself: and the Father that sent me giveth testimony of me.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>They said therefore to him: Where is thy Father? Jesus answered: Neither me do you know, nor my Father: if you did know me, perhaps you would know my Father also.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, teaching in the temple: and no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Again therefore Jesus said to them: I go, and you shall seek me, and you shall die in your sin. Whither I go, you cannot come.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The Jews therefore said: Will he kill himself, because he said: Whither I go, you cannot come?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he said to them: You are from beneath, I am from above. You are of this world, I am not of this world.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Therefore I said to you, that you shall die in your sins. For if you believe not that I am he, you shall die in your sin.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>They said therefore to him: Who art thou? Jesus said to them: The beginning, who also speak unto you.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Many things I have to speak and to judge of you. But he that sent me, is true: and the things I have heard of him, these same I speak in the world.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And they understood not, that he called God his Father.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Jesus therefore said to them: When you shall have lifted up the Son of man, then shall you know, that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself, but as the Father hath taught me, these things I speak:  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And he that sent me, is with me, and he hath not left me alone: for I do always the things that please him.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>When he spoke these things, many believed in him.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then Jesus said to those Jews, who believed him: If you continue in my word, you shall be my disciples indeed.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>They answered him: We are the seed of Abraham, and we have never been slaves to any man: how sayest thou: you shall be free?  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Jesus answered them: Amen, amen I say unto you: that whosoever committeth sin, is the servant of sin.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Now the servant abideth not in the house for ever; but the son abideth for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>If therefore the son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>I know that you are the children of Abraham: but you seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and you do the things that you have seen with your father.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>They answered, and said to him: Abraham is our father. Jesus saith to them: If you be the children of Abraham, do the works of Abraham.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>But now you seek to kill me, a man who have spoken the truth to you, which I have heard of God. This Abraham did not.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>You do the works of your father. They said therefore to him: We are not born of fornication: we have one Father, even God.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Jesus therefore said to them: If God were your Father, you would indeed love me. For from God I proceeded, and came; for I came not of myself, but he sent me:  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Why do you not know my speech? Because you cannot hear my word.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and he stood not in the truth; because truth is not in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>But if I say the truth, you believe me not.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Which of you shall convince me of sin? If I say the truth to you, why do you not believe me?  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>He that is of God, heareth the words of God. Therefore you hear them not, because you are not of God.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>The Jews therefore answered, and said to him: Do not we say well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Jesus answered: I have not a devil: but I honour my Father, and you have dishonoured me.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>But I seek not my own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Amen, amen I say to you: If any man keep my word, he shall not see death for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>The Jews therefore said: Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest: If any man keep my word, he shall not taste death for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? and the prophets are dead. Whom dost thou make thyself?  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>Jesus answered: If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father that glorifieth me, of whom you say that he is your God.  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>And you have not known him, but I know him. And if I shall say that I know him not, I shall be like to you, a liar. But I do know him, and do keep his word.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>Abraham your father rejoiced that he might see my day: he saw it, and was glad.  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>The Jews therefore said to him: Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>Jesus said to them: Amen, amen I say to you, before Abraham was made, I am.  <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>They took up stones therefore to cast at him. But Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple. </div><ul class='tnav'>
