<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 9</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And Jesus passing by, saw a man, who was blind from his birth:  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And his disciples asked him: Rabbi, who hath sinned, this man, or his parents, that he should be born blind?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Jesus answered: Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents; but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I must work the works of him that sent me, whilst it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>When he had said these things, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and spread the clay on his eyes,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And said to him: Go, wash in the pool of Siloe, which is interpreted, Sent. He went therefore, and washed, and he came seeing.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The neighbours therefore, and they who had seen him before that he was a beggar, said: Is not this he that sat and begged? Some said: This is he.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But others said: No, but he is like him. But he said: I am he.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They said therefore to him: How were thy eyes opened?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>He answered: That man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me: Go to the pool of Siloe, and wash. And I went, I washed, and I see.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And they said to him: Where is he? He saith: I know not.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>They bring him that had been blind to the Pharisees.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Now it was the sabbath, when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Again therefore the Pharisees asked him, how he had received his sight. But he said to them: He put clay upon my eyes, and I washed, and I see.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Some therefore of the Pharisees said: This man is not of God, who keepeth not the sabbath. But others said: How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>They say therefore to the blind man again: What sayest thou of him that hath opened they eyes? And he said: He is a prophet.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The Jews then did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And asked them, saying: Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then doth he now see?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>His parents answered them, and said: We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But how he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: ask himself: he is of age, let him speak for himself.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>These things his parents said, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had already agreed among themselves, that if any man should confess him to be Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Therefore did his parents say: He is of age, ask himself.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>They therefore called the man again that had been blind, and said to him: Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>He said therefore to them: If he be a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I see.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>They said then to him: What did he to thee? How did he open thy eyes?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>He answered them: I have told you already, and you have heard: why would you hear it again? will you also become his disciples?  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>They reviled him therefore, and said: Be thou his disciple; but we are the disciples of Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>We know that God spoke to Moses: but as to this man, we know not from whence he is.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>The man answered, and said to them: Why, herein is a wonderful thing, that you know not from whence he is, and he hath opened my eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Now we know that God doth not hear sinners: but if a man be a server of God, and doth his will, him he heareth.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>From the beginning of the world it hath not been heard, that any man hath opened the eyes of one born blind.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Unless this man were of God, he could not do any thing.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>They answered, and said to him: Thou wast wholly born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Jesus heard that they had cast him out: and when he had found him, he said to him: Dost thou believe in the Son of God?  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>He answered, and said: Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And Jesus said to him: Thou hast both seen him; and it is he that talketh with thee.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And he said: I believe, Lord. And falling down, he adored him.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And Jesus said: For judgment I am come into this world; that they who see not, may see; and they who see, may become blind.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And some of the Pharisees, who were with him, heard: and they said unto him: Are we also blind?  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Jesus said to them: If you were blind, you should not have sin: but now you say: We see. Your sin remaineth. </div><ul class='tnav'>
