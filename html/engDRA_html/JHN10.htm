<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 10</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Amen, amen I say to you: He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up another way, the same is a thief and a robber.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And when he hath let out his own sheep, he goeth before them: and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But a stranger they follow not, but fly from him, because they know not the voice of strangers.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>This proverb Jesus spoke to them. But they understood not what he spoke to them.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Jesus therefore said to them again: Amen, amen I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>All others, as many as have come, are thieves and robbers: and the sheep heard them not.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I am the door. By me, if any man enter in, he shall be saved: and he shall go in, and go out, and shall find pastures.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I am come that they may have life, and may have it more abundantly.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd giveth his life for his sheep.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But the hireling, and he that is not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and flieth: and the wolf catcheth, and scattereth the sheep:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the hireling flieth, because he is a hireling: and he hath no care for the sheep.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I am the good shepherd; and I know mine, and mine know me.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>As the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father: and I lay down my life for my sheep.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And other sheep I have, that are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice, and there shall be one fold and one shepherd.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Therefore doth the Father love me: because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>No man taketh it away from me: but I lay it down of myself, and I have power to lay it down: and I have power to take it up again. This commandment have I received of my Father.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>A dissension rose again among the Jews for these words.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And many of them said: He hath a devil, and is mad: why hear you him?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Others said: These are not the words of one that hath a devil: Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem: and it was winter.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Jesus walked in the temple, in Solomon’s porch.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The Jews therefore came round about him, and said to him: How long dost thou hold our souls in suspense? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Jesus answered them: I speak to you, and you believe not: the works that I do in the name of my Father, they give testimony of me.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But you do not believe, because you are not of my sheep.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>My sheep hear my voice: and I know them, and they follow me.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And I give them life everlasting; and they shall not perish for ever, and no man shall pluck them out of my hand.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>That which my Father hath given me, is greater than all: and no one can snatch them out of the hand of my Father.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>I and the Father are one.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The Jews then took up stones to stone him.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Jesus answered them: Many good works I have shewed you from my Father; for which of these works do you stone me?  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>The Jews answered him: For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, maketh thyself God.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Jesus answered them: Is it not written in your law: I said you are gods?  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>If he called them gods, to whom to word of God was spoken, and the scripture cannot be broken;  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Do you say of him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world: Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God?  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>But if I do, though you will not believe me, believe the works: that you may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>They sought therefore to take him; and he escaped out of their hands.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And he went again beyond the Jordan, into that place where John was baptizing first; and there he abode.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And many resorted to him, and they said: John indeed did no sign.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>But all things whatsoever John said of this man, were true. And many believed in him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
