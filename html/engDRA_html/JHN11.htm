<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 11</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Now there was a certain man sick, named Lazarus, of Bethania, of the town of Mary and Martha her sister.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>(And Mary was she that anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair: whose brother Lazarus was sick.)  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>His sisters therefore sent to him, saying: Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And Jesus hearing it, said to them: This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God: that the Son of God may be glorified by it.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister Mary, and Lazarus.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he still remained in the same place two days.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then after that, he said to his disciples: Let us go into Judea again.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The disciples say to him: Rabbi, the Jews but now sought to stone thee: and goest thou thither again?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Jesus answered: Are there not twelve hours of the day? If a man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But if he walk in the night, he stumbleth, because the light is not in him.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>These things he said; and after that he said to them: Lazarus our friend sleepeth; but I go that I may awake him out of sleep.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>His disciples therefore said: Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But Jesus spoke of his death; and they thought that he spoke of the repose of sleep.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then therefore Jesus said to them plainly: Lazarus is dead.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And I am glad, for your sakes, that I was not there, that you may believe: but let us go to him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples: Let us also go, that we may die with him.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Jesus therefore came, and found that he had been four days already in the grave.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>(Now Bethania was near Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off.)  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And many of the Jews were come to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Martha therefore, as soon as she heard that Jesus had come, went to meet him: but Mary sat at home.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Martha therefore said to Jesus: Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But now also I know that whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Jesus saith to her: Thy brother shall rise again.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Martha saith to him: I know that he shall rise again, in the resurrection at the last day.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Jesus said to her: I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, although he be dead, shall live:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And every one that liveth, and believeth in me, shall not die for ever. Believest thou this?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>She saith to him: Yea, Lord, I have believed that thou art Christ the Son of the living God, who art come into this world.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And when she had said these things, she went, and called her sister Mary secretly, saying: The master is come, and calleth for thee.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>She, as soon as she heard this, riseth quickly, and cometh to him.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For Jesus was not yet come into the town: but he was still in that place where Martha had met him.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The Jews therefore, who were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary that she rose up speedily and went out, followed her, saying: She goeth to the grave to weep there.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>When Mary therefore was come where Jesus was, seeing him, she fell down at his feet, and saith to him: Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Jesus, therefore, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews that were come with her, weeping, groaned in the spirit, and troubled himself,  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And said: Where have you laid him? They say to him: Lord, come and see.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And Jesus wept.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>The Jews therefore said: Behold how he loved him.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>But some of them said: Could not he that opened the eyes of the man born blind, have caused that this man should not die?  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Jesus therefore again groaning in himself, cometh to the sepulchre. Now it was a cave; and a stone was laid over it.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Jesus saith: Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith to him: Lord, by this time he stinketh, for he is now of four days.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Jesus saith to her: Did not I say to thee, that if thou believe, thou shalt see the glory of God?  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>They took therefore the stone away. And Jesus lifting up his eyes said: Father, I give thee thanks that thou hast heard me.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And I knew that thou hearest me always; but because of the people who stand about have I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>When he had said these things, he cried with a loud voice: Lazarus, come forth.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And presently he that had been dead came forth, bound feet and hands with winding bands; and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus said to them: Loose him, and let him go.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Many therefore of the Jews, who were come to Mary and Martha, and had seen the things that Jesus did, believed in him.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>But some of them went to the Pharisees, and told them the things that Jesus had done.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>The chief priests therefore, and the Pharisees, gathered a council, and said: What do we, for this man doth many miracles?  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>If we let him alone so, all will believe in him; and the Romans will come, and take away our place and nation.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>But one of them, named Caiphas, being the high priest that year, said to them: You know nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Neither do you consider that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>And this he spoke not of himself: but being the high priest of that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>And not only for the nation, but to gather together in one the children of God, that were dispersed.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>From that day therefore they devised to put him to death.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>Wherefore Jesus walked no more openly among the Jews; but he went into a country near the desert, unto a city that is called Ephrem, and there he abode with his disciples.  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>And the pasch of the Jews was at hand; and many from the country went up to Jerusalem, before the pasch to purify themselves.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>They sought therefore for Jesus; and they discoursed one with another, standing in the temple: What think you that he is not come to the festival day? And the chief priests and Pharisees had given a commandment, that if any man knew where he was, he should tell, that they might apprehend him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
