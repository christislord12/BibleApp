<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 12</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Jesus therefore, six days before the pasch, came to Bethania, where Lazarus had been dead, whom Jesus raised to life.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And they made him a supper there: and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that were at table with him.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of right spikenard, of great price, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, he that was about to betray him, said:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Now he said this, not because he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and having the purse, carried the things that were put therein.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Jesus therefore said: Let her alone, that she may keep it against the day of my burial.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For the poor you have always with you; but me you have not always.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>A great multitude therefore of the Jews knew that he was there; and they came, not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But the chief priests thought to kill Lazarus also:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Because many of the Jews, by reason of him, went away, and believed in Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And on the next day, a great multitude that was to come to the festival day, when they had heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried: Hosanna, blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord, the king of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Jesus found a young ass, and sat upon it, as it is written:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy king cometh, sitting on an ass’s colt.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>These things his disciples did not know at the first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things to him.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The multitude therefore gave testimony, which was with him, when he called Lazarus out of the grave, and raised him from the dead.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For which reason also the people came to meet him, because they heard that he had done this miracle.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The Pharisees therefore said among themselves: Do you see that we prevail nothing? behold, the whole world is gone after him.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Now there were certain Gentiles among them, who came up to adore on the festival day.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>These therefore came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying: Sir, we would see Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Philip cometh, and telleth Andrew. Again Andrew and Philip told Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But Jesus answered them, saying: The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Amen, amen I say to you, unless the grain of wheat falling into the ground die,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Itself remaineth alone. But if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world, keepeth it unto life eternal.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>If any man minister to me, let him follow me; and where I am, there also shall my minister be. If any man minister to me, him will my Father honour.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But for this cause I came unto this hour.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Father, glorify thy name. A voice therefore came from heaven: I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>The multitude therefore that stood and heard, said that it thundered. Others said: An angel spoke to him.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Jesus answered, and said: This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Now is the judgment of the world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all things to myself.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>(Now this he said, signifying what death he should die.)  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>The multitude answered him: We have heard out of the law, that Christ abideth for ever; and how sayest thou: The Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Jesus therefore said to them: Yet a little while, the light is among you. Walk whilst you have the light, that the darkness overtake you not. And he that walketh in darkness, knoweth not whither he goeth.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Whilst you have the light, believe in the light, that you may be the children of light. These things Jesus spoke; and he went away, and hid himself from them.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And whereas he had done so many miracles before them, they believed not in him:  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>That the saying of Isaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he said: Lord, who hath believed our hearing? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Therefore they could not believe, because Isaias said again:  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart, that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>These things said Isaias, when he saw his glory, and spoke of him.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>However, many of the chief men also believed in him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, that they might not be cast out of the synagogue.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>But Jesus cried, and said: He that believeth in me, doth not believe in me, but in him that sent me.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And he that seeth me, seeth him that sent me.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>I am come a light into the world; that whosoever believeth in me, may not remain in darkness.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And if any man hear my words, and keep them not, I do not judge him: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>He that despiseth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him; the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father who sent me, he gave me commandment what I should say, and what I should speak.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>And I know that his commandment is life everlasting. The things therefore that I speak, even as the Father said unto me, so do I speak. </div><ul class='tnav'>
