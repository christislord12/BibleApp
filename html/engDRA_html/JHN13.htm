<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 13</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Before the festival day of the pasch, Jesus knowing that his hour was come, that he should pass out of this world to the Father: having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them unto the end.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And when supper was done, (the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to betray him,)  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Knowing that the Father had given him all things into his hands, and that he came from God, and goeth to God;  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>He riseth from supper, and layeth aside his garments, and having taken a towel, girded himself.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>After that, he putteth water into a basin, and began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>He cometh therefore to Simon Peter. And Peter saith to him: Lord, dost thou wash my feet?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Jesus answered, and said to him: What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Peter saith to him: Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him: If I wash thee not, thou shalt have no part with me.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Simon Peter saith to him: Lord, not only my feet, but also my hands and my head.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Jesus saith to him: He that is washed, needeth not but to wash his feet, but is clean wholly. And you are clean, but not all.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For he knew who he was that would betray him; therefore he said: You are not all clean.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then after he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, being set down again, he said to them: Know you what I have done to you?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>You call me Master, and Lord; and you say well, for so I am.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>If then I being your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; you also ought to wash one another’s feet.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For I have given you an example, that as I have done to you, so you do also.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Amen, amen I say to you: The servant is not greater than his lord; neither is the apostle greater than he that sent him.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>If you know these things, you shall be blessed if you do them.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen. But that the scripture may be fulfilled: He that eateth bread with me, shall lift up his heel against me.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>At present I tell you, before it come to pass: that when it shall come to pass, you may believe that I am he.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Amen, amen I say to you, he that receiveth whomsoever I send, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>When Jesus had said these things, he was troubled in spirit; and he testified, and said: Amen, amen I say to you, one of you shall betray me.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The disciples therefore looked one upon another, doubting of whom he spoke.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Now there was leaning on Jesus’ bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, and said to him: Who is it of whom he speaketh?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>He therefore, leaning on the breast of Jesus, saith to him: Lord, who is it?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Jesus answered: He it is to whom I shall reach bread dipped. And when he had dipped the bread, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And after the morsel, Satan entered into him. And Jesus said to him: That which thou dost, do quickly.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Now no man at the table knew to what purpose he said this unto him.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For some thought, because Judas had the purse, that Jesus had said to him: Buy those things which we have need of for the festival day: or that he should give something to the poor.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>He therefore having received the morsel, went out immediately. And it was night.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>When he therefore was gone out, Jesus said: Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>If God be glorified in him, God also will glorify him in himself; and immediately will he glorify him.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You shall seek me; and as I said to the Jews: Whither I go you cannot come; so I say to you now.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>A new commandment I give unto you: That you love one another, as I have loved you, that you also love one another.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you have love one for another.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Simon Peter saith to him: Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered: Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow hereafter.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Peter saith to him: Why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thee.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Jesus answered him: Wilt thou lay down thy life for me? Amen, amen I say to thee, the cock shall not crow, till thou deny me thrice. </div><ul class='tnav'>
