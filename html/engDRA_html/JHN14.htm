<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 14</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in me.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>In my Father’s house there are many mansions. If not, I would have told you: because I go to prepare a place for you.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And if I shall go, and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and will take you to myself; that where I am, you also may be.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And whither I go you know, and the way you know.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Thomas saith to him: Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Jesus saith to him: I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No man cometh to the Father, but by me.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>If you had known me, you would without doubt have known my Father also: and from henceforth you shall know him, and you have seen him.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Philip saith to him: Lord, shew us the Father, and it is enough for us.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Jesus saith to him: Have I been so long a time with you; and have you not known me? Philip, he that seeth me seeth the Father also. How sayest thou, Shew us the Father?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Do you not believe, that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I speak to you, I speak not of myself. But the Father who abideth in me, he doth the works.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Believe you not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Otherwise believe for the very works’ sake. Amen, amen I say to you, he that believeth in me, the works that I do, he also shall do; and greater than these shall he do.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Because I go to the Father: and whatsoever you shall ask the Father in my name, that will I do: that the Father may be glorified in the Son.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>If you shall ask me any thing in my name, that I will do.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>If you love me, keep my commandments.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And I will ask the Father, and he shall give you another Paraclete, that he may abide with you for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, nor knoweth him: but you shall know him; because he shall abide with you, and shall be in you.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I will not leave you orphans, I will come to you.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Yet a little while: and the world seeth me no more. But you see me: because I live, and you shall live.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>In that day you shall know, that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them; he it is that loveth me. And he that loveth me, shall be loved of my Father: and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Judas saith to him, not the Iscariot: Lord, how is it, that thou wilt manifest thyself to us, and not to the world?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Jesus answered, and said to him: If any one love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and will make our abode with him.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>He that loveth me not, keepeth not my words. And the word which you have heard, is not mine; but the Father’s who sent me.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>These things have I spoken to you, abiding with you.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But the Paraclete, the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring all things to your mind, whatsoever I shall have said to you.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, do I give unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, nor let it be afraid.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>You have heard that I said to you: I go away, and I come unto you. If you loved me, you would indeed be glad, because I go to the Father: for the Father is greater than I.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And now I have told you before it comes to pass: that when it shall come to pass, you may believe.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>I will not now speak many things with you. For the prince of this world cometh, and in me he hath not any thing.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>But that the world may know, that I love the Father: and as the Father hath given me commandment, so do I: Arise, let us go hence. </div><ul class='tnav'>
