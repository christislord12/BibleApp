As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abide in the vine, so neither can you, unless you abide in me.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>I am the vine: you the branches: he that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit: for without me you can do nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>If any one abide not in me, he shall be cast forth as a branch, and shall wither, and they shall gather him up, and case him into the fire, and be burneth.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, you shall ask whatever you will, and it shall be done unto you.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>In this is my Father glorified; that you bring forth very much fruit, and become my disciples.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>As the Father hath loved me, I also have loved you.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>If you keep my commandments, you shall abide in my love; as I also have kept my Father’s commandments, and do abide in his love.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and your joy may be filled.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>This is my commandment, that you love one another, as I have loved you.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Greater love than this no man hath, that a man lay down his life for his friends.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>You are my friends, if you do the things that I command you.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>I will not now call you servants: for the servant knoweth not what his lord doth. But I have called you friends: because all things whatsoever I have heard of my Father, I have made known to you.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>You have not chosen me: but I have chosen you; and have appointed you, that you should go, and should bring forth fruit; and your fruit should remain: that whatsoever you shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>These things I command you, that you love one another.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>If the world hate you, know ye, that it hath hated me before you.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>If you had been of the world, the world would love its own: but because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Remember my word that I said to you: The servant is not greater than his master. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you: if they have kept my word, they will keep yours also.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But all these things they will do to you for my name’s sake: because they know not him who sent me.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>If I had not come, and spoken to them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>He that hateth me, hateth my Father also.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>If I had not done among them the works that no other man hath done, they would not have sin; but now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But that the word may be fulfilled which is written in their law: They hated me without cause.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But when the Paraclete cometh, whom I will send you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceedeth from the Father, he shall give testimony of me.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And you shall give testimony, because you are with me from the beginning. </div><ul class='tnav'>
