<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 16</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>These things have I spoken to you, that you may not be scandalized.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>They will put you out of the synagogues: yea, the hour cometh, that whosoever killeth you, will think that he doth a service to God.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And these things will they do to you; because they have not known the Father, nor me.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But these things I have told you, that when the hour shall come, you may remember that I told you of them.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But I told you not these things from the beginning, because I was with you. And now I go to him that sent me, and none of you asketh me: Whither goest thou?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow hath filled your heart.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But I tell you the truth: it is expedient to you that I go: for if I go not, the Paraclete will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And when he is come, he will convince the world of sin, and of justice, and of judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Of sin: because they believed not in me.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And of justice: because I go to the Father; and you shall see me no longer.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And of judgment: because the prince of this world is already judged.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I have yet many things to say to you: but you cannot bear them now.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will teach you all truth. For he shall not speak of himself; but what things soever he shall hear, he shall speak; and the things that are to come, he shall shew you.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He shall glorify me; because he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it to you.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>All things whatsoever the Father hath, are mine. Therefore I said, that he shall receive of mine, and shew it to you.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>A little while, and now you shall not see me; and again a little while, and you shall see me: because I go to the Father.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then some of the disciples said one to another: What is this that he saith to us: A little while, and you shall not see me; and again a little while, and you shall see me, and, because I go to the Father?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>They said therefore: What is this that he saith, A little while? we know not what he speaketh.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Jesus knew that they had a mind to ask him; and he said to them: Of this do you inquire among yourselves, because I said: A little while, and you shall not see me; and again a little while, and you shall see me?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Amen, amen I say to you, that you shall lament and weep, but the world shall rejoice; and you shall be made sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>A woman, when she is in labour, hath sorrow, because her hour is come; but when she hath brought forth the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So also you now indeed have sorrow; but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice; and your joy no man shall take from you.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And in that day you shall not ask me any thing. Amen, amen I say to you: if you ask the Father any thing in my name, he will give it you.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Hitherto you have not asked any thing in my name. Ask, and you shall receive; that your joy may be full.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>These things I have spoken to you in proverbs. The hour cometh, when I will no more speak to you in proverbs, but will shew you plainly of the Father.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>In that day you shall ask in my name; and I say not to you, that I will ask the Father for you:  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For the Father himself loveth you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again I leave the world, and I go to the Father.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>His disciples say to him: Behold, now thou speakest plainly, and speakest no proverb.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Now we know that thou knowest all things, and thou needest not that any man should ask thee. By this we believe that thou camest forth from God.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Jesus answered them: Do you now believe?  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Behold, the hour cometh, and it is now come, that you shall be scattered every man to his own, and shall leave me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>These things I have spoken to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you shall have distress: but have confidence, I have overcome the world. </div><ul class='tnav'>
