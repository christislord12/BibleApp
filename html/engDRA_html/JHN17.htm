Thine they were, and to me thou gavest them; and they have kept thy word.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Now they have known, that all things which thou hast given me, are from thee:  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Because the words which thou gavest me, I have given to them; and they have received them, and have known in very deed that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them whom thou hast given me: because they are thine:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And all my things are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And now I am not in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep them in thy name whom thou has given me; that they may be one, as we also are.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>While I was with them, I kept them in thy name. Those whom thou gavest me have I kept; and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition, that the scripture may be fulfilled.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And now I come to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy filled in themselves.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I have given them thy word, and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world; as I also am not of the world.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>I pray not that thou shouldst take them out of the world, but that thou shouldst keep them from evil.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>They are not of the world, as I also am not of the world.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Sanctify them in truth. Thy word is truth.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>As thou hast sent me into the world, I also have sent them into the world.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And for them do I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified in truth.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And not for them only do I pray, but for them also who through their word shall believe in me;  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>That they all may be one, as thou, Father, in me, and I in thee; that they also may be one in us; that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the glory which thou hast given me, I have given to them; that they may be one, as we also are one:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>I in them, and thou in me; that they may be made perfect in one: and the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast also loved me.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Father, I will that where I am, they also whom thou hast given me may be with me; that they may see my glory which thou hast given me, because thou hast loved me before the creation of the world.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Just Father, the world hath not known thee; but I have known thee: and these have known that thou hast sent me.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And I have made known thy name to them, and will make it known; that the love wherewith thou hast loved me, may be in them, and I in them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
