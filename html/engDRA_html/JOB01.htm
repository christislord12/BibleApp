</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>There was a man in the land of Hus, whose name was Job, and that man was simple and upright, and fearing God, and avoiding evil.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And his possession was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a family exceeding great: and this man was great among all the people of the east.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And his sons went, and made a feast by houses every one in his day. And sending they called their three sisters to eat and drink with them.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And when the days of their feasting were gone about, Job sent to them, and sanctified them: and rising up early offered holocausts for every one of them. For he said: Lest perhaps my sons have sinned, and have blessed God in their hearts. So did Job all days.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Now on a certain day when the sons of God came to stand before the Lord, Satan also was present among them.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the Lord said to him: Whence comest thou? And he answered and said: I have gone round about the earth, and walked through it.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the Lord said to him: Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a simple and upright man, and fearing God, and avoiding evil?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Satan answering, said: Doth Job fear God in vain?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Hast not thou made a fence for him, and his house, and all his substance round about, blessed the works of his hands, and his possession hath increased on the earth?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But stretch forth thy hand a little, and touch all that he hath, and see if he blesseth thee not to thy face.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then the Lord said to Satan: Behold, all that he hath is in thy hand: only put not forth thy hand upon his person. And Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Now upon a certain day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their eldest brother,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>There came a messenger to Job, and said: The oxen were ploughing, and the asses feeding beside them,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the Sabeans rushed in, and took all away, and slew the servants with the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell thee.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And while he was yet speaking, another came, and said: The fire of God fell from heaven, and striking the sheep and the servants, hath consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell thee.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And while he also was yet speaking, there came another, and said: The Chaldeans made three troops, and have fallen upon the camels, and taken them, moreover they have slain the servants with the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell thee.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>He was yet speaking, and behold another came in, and said: Thy sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their elder brother:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>A violent wind came on a sudden from the side of the desert, and shook the four corners of the house, and it fell upon thy children and they are dead, and I alone have escaped to fell thee.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then Job rose up, and rent his garments, and having shaven his head fell down upon the ground and worshipped,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And said: Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away: as it hath pleased the Lord so is it done: blessed be the name of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>In all these things Job sinned not by his lips, nor spoke he any foolish thing against God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
