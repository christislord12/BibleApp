If I speak, my pain will not rest: and if I hold my peace, it will not depart from me.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But now my sorrow hath oppressed me, and all my limbs are brought to nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>My wrinkles bear witness against me, and a false speaker riseth up against my face, contradicting me.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He hath gathered together his fury against me, and threatening me he hath gnashed with his teeth upon me: my enemy hath beheld me with terrible eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>They have opened their mouths upon me, and reproaching me they have struck me on the cheek, they are filled with my pains.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>God hath shut me up with the unjust man, and hath delivered me into the hands of the wicked.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I that was formerly so wealthy, am all on a sudden broken to pieces: he hath taken me by my neck, he hath broken me, and hath set me up to be his mark.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He hath compassed me round about with his lances, he hath wounded my loins, he hath not spared, and hath poured out my bowels on the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He hath torn me with wound upon wound, he hath rushed in upon me like a giant.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I have sowed sackcloth upon my skin, and have covered my flesh with ashes.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>My face is swollen with weeping, and my eyelids are dim.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>These things have I suffered without the iniquity of my hand, when I offered pure prayers to God.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>O earth, cover not thou my blood, neither let my cry find a hiding place in thee.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For behold my witness is in heaven, and he that knoweth my conscience is on high.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>My friends are full of words: my eye poureth out tears to God.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And O that a man might so be judged with God, as the son of man is judged with his companion!  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For behold short years pass away and I am walking in a path by which I shall not return. </div><ul class='tnav'>
