My bone hath cleaved to my skin, and nothing but lips are left about my teeth.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Have pity on me, have pity on me, at least you my friends, because the hand of the Lord hath touched me.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Why do you persecute me as God, and glut yourselves with my flesh?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Who will grant me that my words may be written? Who will grant me that they may be marked down in a book?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>With an iron pen and in a plate of lead, or else be graven with an instrument in flint stone.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and in the last day I shall rise out of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And I shall be clothed again with my skin, and in my flesh I will see my God.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Whom I myself shall see, and my eyes shall behold, and not another: this my hope is laid up in my bosom.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Why then do you say now: Let us persecute him, and let us find occasion of word against him?  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Flee then from the face of the sword, for the sword is the revenger of iniquities: and know ye that there is judgment. </div><ul class='tnav'>
