I shall not take hold on him: if I turn myself to the right hand, I shall not see him.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But he knoweth my way, and has tried me as gold that passeth through the fire:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>My foot hath followed his steps, I have kept his way, and have not declined from it.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I have not departed from the commandments of his lips, and the words of his mouth I have hid in my bosom.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For he is alone, and no man can turn away his thought: and whatsoever is soul hath desired, that hath he done.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And when he shall have fulfilled his will in me, many other like things are also at hand with him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And therefore I am troubled at his presence, and when I consider him I am made pensive with fear.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>God hath softened my heart, and the Almighty hath troubled me.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For I have not perished because of the darkness that hangs over me, neither hath the mist covered my face. </div><ul class='tnav'>
