<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 31</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>I made a covenant with my eyes, that I would not so much as think upon a virgin.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>For what part should God from above have in me, and what inheritance the Almighty from on high?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Is not destruction to the wicked, and aversion to them that work iniquity?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Doth not he consider my ways, and number all my steps?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>If I have walked in vanity, and my foot hath made haste to deceit:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Let him weigh me in a just balance, and let God know my simplicity.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>If my step hath turned out of the way, and if my heart hath followed my eyes, and if a spot hath cleaved to my hands:  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then let me sow and let another eat: and let my offspring be rooted out.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>If my heart hath been deceived upon a woman, and if I have laid wait at my friend’s door:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Let my wife be the harlot of another, and let other men lie with her.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For this is a heinous crime, and a most grievous iniquity.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>It is a fire that devoureth even to destruction, and rooteth up all things that spring.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>If I have despised to abide judgment with my manservant, or my maidservant, when they had any controversy against me:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For what shall I do when God shall rise to judge? and when he shall examine, what shall I answer him?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Did not he that made me in the womb make him also: and did not one and the same form me in the womb?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>If I have denied to the poor what they desired, and have made the eyes of the widow wait:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>If I have eaten my morsel alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>(For from my infancy mercy grew up with me: and it came out with me from my mother’s womb:)  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>If I have despised him that was perishing for want of clothing, and the poor man that had no covering:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>If his sides have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, even when I saw myself superior in the gate:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Let my shoulder fall from its joint, and let my arm with its bones be broken.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For I have always feared God as waves swelling over me, and his weight I was not able to bear.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>If I have thought gold my strength, and have said to fine gold: My confidence:  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>If I have rejoiced over my great riches, and because my hand had gotten much.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>If I beheld the sun when it shined, and the moon going in brightness:  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And my heart in secret hath rejoiced, and I have kissed my hand with my mouth:  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Which is a very great iniquity, and a denial against the most high God.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>If I have been glad at the downfall of him that hated me, and have rejoiced that evil had found him.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For I have not given my mouth to sin, by wishing a curse to his soul.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>If the men of my tabernacle have not said: Who will give us of his flesh that we may be filled?  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>The stranger did not stay without, my door was open to the traveller.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>If as a man I have hid my sin, and have concealed my iniquity in my bosom.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>If I have been afraid at a very great multitude, and the contempt of kinsmen hath terrified me: and I have not rather held my peace, and not gone out of the door.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Who would grant me a hearer, that the Almighty may hear my desire; and that he himself that judgeth would write a book,  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>That I may carry it on my shoulder, and put it about me as a crown?  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>At every step of mine I would pronounce it, and offer it as to a prince.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>If my land cry against me, and with it the furrows thereof mourn:  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, and have afflicted the soul of the tillers thereof:  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Let thistles grow up to me instead of wheat, and thorns instead of barley. </div><ul class='tnav'>
