<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 32</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he seemed just to himself.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And Eliu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram, was angry and was moved to indignation: now he was angry against Job, because he said he was just before God.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And he was angry with his friends because they had not found a reasonable answer, but only had condemned Job.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>So Eliu waited while Job was speaking, because they were his elders that were speaking.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But when he saw that the three were not able to answer, he was exceedingly angry.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then Eliu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said: I am younger in days, and you are more ancient; therefore hanging down my head, I was afraid to shew you my opinion.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For I hoped that greater age would speak, and that a multitude of years would teach wisdom.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But, as I see, there is a spirit in men, and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth understanding.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>They that are aged are not the wise men, neither do the ancients understand judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Therefore I will speak: Hearken to me, I also will shew you my wisdom.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For I have waited for your words, I have given ear to your wisdom, as long as you were disputing in words.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And as long as I thought you said some thing, I considered: but, as I see, there is none of you that can convince Job, and answer his words.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Lest you should say: We have found wisdom, God hath cast him down, not man.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He hath spoken nothing to me, and I will not answer him according to your words.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>They were afraid, and answered no more, and they left off speaking.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Therefore because I have waited, and they have not spoken: they stood, and answered no more:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>I also will answer my part, and will shew my knowledge.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For I am full of matter to speak of, and the spirit of my bowels straiteneth me.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Behold, my belly is as new wine which wanteth vent, which bursteth the new vessels.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>I will speak and take breath a little: I will open my lips, and will answer.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>I will not accept the person of man, and I will not level God with man.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For I know not how long I shall continue, and whether after a while my Maker may take me away. </div><ul class='tnav'>
