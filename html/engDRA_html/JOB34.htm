When he hideth his countenance, who is there that can behold him, whether it regard nations, or all men?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Who maketh a man that is a hypocrite to reign for the sins of the people?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Seeing then I have spoken of God, I will not hinder thee in thy turn.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>If I have erred, teach thou me: if I have spoken iniquity, I will add no more.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Doth God require it of thee, because it hath displeased thee? for thou begannest to speak, and not I: but if thou know any thing better, speak.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Let men of understanding speak to me, and let a wise man hearken to me.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>But Job hath spoken foolishly, and his words sound not discipline.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>My father, let Job be tried even to the end: cease not from the man of iniquity.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Because he addeth blasphemy upon his sins, let him be tied fast in the mean time amongst us: and then let him provoke God to judgment with his speeches. </div><ul class='tnav'>
