<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 38</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then the Lord answered Job out of a whirlwind, and said:  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Who is this that wrappeth up sentences in unskillful words?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Gird up thy loins like a man: I will ask thee, and answer thou me.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Where wast thou when I laid up the foundations of the earth? tell me if thou hast understanding.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Upon what are its bases grounded? or who laid the corner stone thereof,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>When the morning stars praised me together, and all the sons of God made a joyful melody?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Who shut up the sea with doors, when it broke forth as issuing out of the womb:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>When I made a cloud the garment thereof, and wrapped it in a mist as in swaddling bands?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I set my bounds around it, and made it bars and doors:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And I said: Hitherto thou shalt come, and shalt go no further, and here thou shalt break thy swelling waves.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Didst thou since thy birth command the morning, and shew the dawning of the day its place?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And didst thou hold the extremities of the earth shaking them, and hast thou shaken the ungodly out of it?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The seal shall be restored as clay, and shall stand as a garment:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>From the wicked their light shall be taken away, and the high arm shall be broken.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Hast thou entered into the depths of the sea, and walked in the lowest parts of the deep?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Have the gates of death been opened to thee, and hast thou seen the darksome doors?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Hast thou considered the breadth of the earth? tell me, if thou knowest all things?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Where is the way where light dwelleth, and where is the place of darkness:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>That thou mayst bring every thing to its own bounds, and understand the paths of the house thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Didst thou know then that thou shouldst be born? and didst thou know the number of thy days?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Hast thou entered into the storehouses of the snow, or has thou beheld the treasures of the hail:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Which I have prepared for the time of the enemy, against the day of battle and war?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>By what way is the light spread, and heat divided upon the earth?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Who gave a course to violent showers, or a way for noisy thunder:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>That it should rain on the earth without man in the wilderness, where no mortal dwelleth:  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>That it should fill the desert and desolate land, and should bring forth green grass?  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Who is the father of rain? or who begot the drops of dew?  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Out of whose womb came the ice; and the frost from heaven who hath gendered it?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>The waters are hardened like a stone, and the surface of the deep is congealed.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Shalt thou be able to join together the shining stars the Pleiades, or canst thou stop the turning about of Arcturus?  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Canst thou bring forth the day star in its time, and make the evening star to rise upon the children of the earth?  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Dost thou know the order of heaven, and canst thou set down the reason thereof on the earth?  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that an abundance of waters may cover thee?  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Canst thou send lightnings, and will they go, and will they return and say to thee: Here we are?  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Who hath put wisdom in the heart of man? or who gave the cock understanding?  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Who can declare the order of the heavens, or who can make the harmony of heaven to sleep?  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>When was the dust poured on the earth, and the clods fastened together?  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Wilt thou take the prey for the lioness, and satisfy the appetite of her whelps,  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>When they couch in the dens and lie in wait in holes?  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Who provideth food for the raven, when her young ones cry to God, wandering about, because they have no meat? </div><ul class='tnav'>
