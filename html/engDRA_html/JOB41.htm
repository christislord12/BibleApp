All things that are under heaven are mine.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I will not spare him, nor his mighty words, and framed to make supplication.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can go into the midst of his mouth?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>His body is like molten shields, shut close up with scales pressing upon one another.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>One is joined to another, and not so much as any air can come between them:  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>They stick one to another and they hold one another fast, and shall not be separated.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>His sneezing is like the shining of fire, and his eyes like the eyelids of the morning.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Out of his mouth go forth lamps, like torches of lighted fire.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, like that of a pot heated and boiling.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>His breath kindleth coals, and a flame cometh forth out of his mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>In his neck strength shall dwell, and want goeth before his face.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The members of his flesh cleave one to another: he shall send lightnings against him, and they shall not be carried to another place.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>His heart shall be as hard as a stone, and as firm as a smith’s anvil.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>When he shall raise him up, the angels shall fear, and being affrighted shall purify themselves.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>When a sword shall lay at him, it shall not be able to hold, nor a spear, nor a breastplate.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For he shall esteem iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The archer shall not put him to flight, the stones of the sling are to him like stubble.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>As stubble will he esteem the hammer, and he will laugh him to scorn who shaketh the spear.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The beams of the sun shall be under him, and he shall strew gold under him like mire.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>He shall make the deep sea to boil like a pot, and shall make it as when ointments boil.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>A path shall shine after him, he shall esteem the deep as growing old.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>There is no power upon earth that can be compared with him who was made to fear no one.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>He beholdeth every high thing, he is king over all the children of pride. </div><ul class='tnav'>
