<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 42</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then Job answered the Lord, and said:  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I know that thou canst do all things, and no thought is hid from thee.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Who is this that hideth counsel without knowledge? Therefore I have spoken unwisely, and things that above measure exceeded my knowledge.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Hear, and I will speak: I will ask thee, and do thou tell me.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>With the hearing of the ear, I have heard thee, but now my eye seeth thee.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Therefore I reprehend myself, and do penance in dust and ashes.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And after the Lord had spoken these words to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Themanite: My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends, because you have not spoken the thing that is right before my, as my servant Job hath.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Take unto you therefore seven oxen, and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer for yourselves a holocaust: and my servant Job shall pray for you: his face I will accept, that folly be not imputed to you: for you have not spoken right things before me, as my servant Job hath.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So Eliphaz the Themanite, and Baldad the Suhite, and Sophar the Naamathite went, and did as the Lord had spoken to them, and the Lord accepted the face of Job.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The Lord also was turned at the penance of Job, when he prayed for his friends. And the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And all his brethren came to him, and all his sisters, and all that knew him before, and they ate bread with him in his house: and bemoaned him, and comforted him upon all the evil that God had brought upon him. And every man gave him one ewe, and one earring of fold.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning. And he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And he had seven sons, and three daughters.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he called the names of one Dies, and the name of the second Cassia, and the name of the third Cornustibil.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And there were not found in all the earth women so beautiful as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Job lived after these things, a hundred and forty years, and he saw his children, and his children’s children, unto the fourth generation, and he died an old man, and full of days. </div><ul class='tnav'>
