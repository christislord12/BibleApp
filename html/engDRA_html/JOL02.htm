Why should they say among the nations: Where is their God?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The Lord hath been zealous for his land, and hath spared his people.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the Lord answered and said to his people: Behold I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and you shall be filled with them: and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And I will remove far off from you the northern enemy: and I will drive him into a land unpassable, and desert, with his face towards the east sea, and his hinder part towards the utmost sea: and his stench shall ascend, and his rottenness shall go up, because he hath done proudly.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Fear not, O land, be glad and rejoice: for the Lord hath done great things.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Fear not, ye beasts of the fields: for the beautiful places of the wilderness are sprung, for the tree hath brought forth its fruit, the fig tree, and the vine have yielded their strength.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And you, O children of Sion, rejoice, and be joyful in the Lord your God: because he hath given you a teacher of justice, and he will make the early and the latter rain to come down to you as in the beginning.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the floors shall be filled with wheat, and the presses shall overflow with wine and oil.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And I will restore to you the ears which the locust, and the bruchus, and the mildew, and the palmerworm have eaten; my great host which I sent upon you.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And you shall eat in plenty, and shall be filled: and you shall praise the name of the Lord your God, who hath done wonders with you, and my people shall not be confounded for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel: and I am the Lord your God, and there is none besides: and my people shall not be confounded for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass after this, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy: your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Moreover upon my servants and handmaids in those days I will pour forth my spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And I will shew wonders in heaven; and in earth, blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood: before the great and dreadful day of the Lord doth come.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass, that every one that shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved: for in mount Sion, and in Jerusalem shall be salvation, as the Lord hath said, and in the residue whom the Lord shall call. </div><ul class='tnav'>
