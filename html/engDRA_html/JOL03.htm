Let the weak say: I am strong.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Break forth, and come, all ye nations, from round about, and gather yourselves together: there will the Lord cause all thy strong ones to fall down.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Let them arise, and let the nations come up into the valley of Josaphat: for there I will sit to judge all nations round about.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Put ye in the sickles, for the harvest is ripe: come and go down, for the press is full, the fats run over: for their wickedness is multiplied.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Nations, nations in the valley of destruction: for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of destruction.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars have withdrawn their shining.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the Lord shall roar out of Sion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem: and the heavens and the earth shall be moved, and the Lord shall be the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And you shall know that I am the Lord your God, dwelling in Sion my holy mountain: and Jerusalem shall be holy and strangers shall pass through it no more.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down sweetness, and the hills shall flow with milk: and waters shall flow through all the rivers of Juda: and a fountain shall come forth of the house of the Lord, and shall water the torrent of thorns.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom a wilderness destroyed: because they have done unjustly against the children of Juda, and have shed innocent blood in their land.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Judea shall be inhabited for ever, and Jerusalem to generation and generation.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And I will cleanse their blood which I had not cleansed: and the Lord will dwell in Sion. </div><ul class='tnav'>
