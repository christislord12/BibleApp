And they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonas.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And they said to him: Tell us for what cause this evil is upon us, what is thy business? of what country art thou? and whither goest thou? or of what people art thou?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he said to them: I am a Hebrew, and I fear the Lord the God of heaven, who made both the sea and the dry land.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the men were greatly afraid, and they said to him: Why hast thou done this? (for the men knew that he fled from the face of the Lord: because he had told them.)  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And they said to him: What shall we do to thee, that the sea may be calm to us? for the sea flowed and swelled.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he said to them: Take me up, and cast me into the sea, and the sea shall be calm to you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the men rowed hard to return to land, but they were not able: because the sea tossed and swelled upon them.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And they cried to the Lord, and said: We beseech thee, O Lord, let us not perish for this man’s life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O Lord, hast done as it pleased thee.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And they took Jonas, and cast him into the sea, and the sea ceased from raging.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the men feared the Lord exceedingly, and sacrificed victims to the Lord, and made vows. </div><ul class='tnav'>
