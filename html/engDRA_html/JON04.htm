And he said: I am angry with reason even unto death.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the Lord said: Thou art grieved for the ivy, for which thou hast not laboured, nor made it to grow, which in one night came up, and in one night perished.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And shall not I spare Ninive, that great city, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons that know not how to distinguish between their right hand and their left, and many beasts? </div><ul class='tnav'>
