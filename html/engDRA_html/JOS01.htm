Fear not and be not dismayed: because the Lord thy God is with thee in all things whatsoever thou shalt go to.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Josue commanded the princes of the people, saying: Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people, and say:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Prepare you victuals: for after the third day you shall pass over the Jordan and shall go in to possess the land, which the Lord your God will give you.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he said to the Rubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasses:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Remember the word, which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, saying: The Lord your God hath given you rest, and all this land.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Your wives, and children, and cattle shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan: but pass you over armed before your brethren, all of you that are strong of hand, and fight for them,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Until the Lord give rest to your brethren as he hath given you, and they also possess the land which the Lord your God will give them: and so you shall return into the land of your possession, and you shall dwell in it, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you beyond the Jordan, toward the rising of the sun.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And they made answer to Josue, and said: All that thou hast commanded us we will do; and whithersoever thou shalt send us, we will go.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>As we obeyed Moses in all things, so will we obey thee also: only be the Lord thy God with thee, as he was with Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>He that shall gainsay thy mouth, and not obey all thy words, that thou shalt command him, let him die: only take thou courage, and do manfully. </div><ul class='tnav'>
