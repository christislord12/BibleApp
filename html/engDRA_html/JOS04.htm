And the people made haste and passed over.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And when they had all passed over, the ark also of the Lord passed over, and the priests went before the people.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The children of Ruben also and Gad, and half the tribe of Manasses, went armed before the children of Israel as Moses had commanded them.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And forty thousand fighting men by their troops, and bands, marched through the plains and fields of the city of Jericho.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>In that day the Lord magnified Josue in the sight of all Israel, that they should fear him, as they had feared Moses, while he lived.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he said to him:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Command the priests, that carry the ark of the covenant, to come up out of the Jordan.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he commanded them, saying: Come ye up out of the Jordan.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And when they that carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, were come up, and began to tread on the dry ground, the waters returned into the channel, and ran as they were wont before.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the people came up out of the Jordan, the tenth day of the first month, and camped in Galgal, over against the east side of the city of Jericho.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the twelve stones which they had taken out of the channel of the Jordan, Josue pitched in Galgal,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And said to the children of Israel: When your children shall ask their fathers, tomorrow, and shall say to them: What mean these stones?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>You shall teach them and say: Israel passed over this Jordan through the dry channel.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The Lord your God drying up the waters thereof in your sight, until you passed over:  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>As he had done before in the Red Sea, which he dried up till we passed through:  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>That all the people of the earth may learn the most mighty hand of the Lord, that you also may fear the Lord your God for ever. </div><ul class='tnav'>
