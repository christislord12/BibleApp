<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 13</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Josue was old, and far advanced in years, and the Lord said to him: Thou art grown old, and advanced in age, and there is a very large country left, which is not yet divided by lot:  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>To wit, all Galilee, Philistia, and all Gessuri.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>From the troubled river, that watereth Egypt, unto the borders of Accaron northward: the land of Chanaan, which is divided among the lords of the Philistines, the Gazites, the Azotians, the Ascalonites, the Gethites, and the Accronites.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And on the south side are the Hevites, all the land of Chanaan, and Maara of the Sidonians as far as Apheca, and the borders of the Amorrhite,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And his confines. The country also of Libanus towards the east from Baalgad under mount Hermon to the entering into Emath.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Of all that dwell in the mountains from Libanus, to the waters of Maserephoth, and all the Sidonians. I am he that will cut them off from before the face of the children of Israel. So let their land come in as a part of the inheritance of Israel, as I have commanded thee.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And now divide the land in possession to the nine tribes, and to the half tribe of Manasses,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>With whom Ruben and Gad have possessed the land, which Moses the servant of the Lord delivered to them beyond the river Jordan, on the east side.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>From Aroer, which is upon the bank of the torrent Amen, and in the midst of the valley and all the plains of Medaba, as far as Dibon:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And all the cities of Sehon, king of the Amorrhites, who reigned in Hesebon, unto the borders of the children of Ammon.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Galaad, and the borders of Gessuri and Machati, and all mount Hermon, and all Basan as far as Salecha,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>All the kingdom of Og in Basan, who reigned in Astaroth and Edrai, he was of the remains of the Raphaims: and Moses overthrew and destroyed them.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the children of Israel would not destroy Gessuri and Machati: and they have dwelt in the midst of Israel, until this present day.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But to the tribe of Levi he gave no possession: but the sacrifices and victims of the Lord God of Israel, are his inheritance, as he spoke to him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Moses gave a possession to the children of Ruben according to their kindreds.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And their border was from Aroer, which is on the bank of the torrent Arnon, and in the midst of the valley of the same torrent: all the plain, that leadeth to Medaba,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Hesebon, and all their villages, which are in the plains. Dibon also, and Bamothbaal, and the town of Baalmaon,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Jassa, and Cidimoth, and Mephaath,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Cariathaim, and Sabama, and Sarathasar in the mountain of the valley.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Bethphogor and Asedoth, Phasga and Bethiesimoth,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdoms of Sehon king of the Amorrhites, that reigned in Hesebon, whom Moses slew with the princes of Madian: Hevi, and Recem, and Sur and Hur, and Rebe, dukes of Sehon inhabitants of the land.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Balaam also the son of Beer the soothsayer, the children of Israel slew with the sword among the rest that were slain.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the river Jordan was the herder of the children of Ruben. This is the possession of the Rubenites, by their kindreds, of cities and villages.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Moses gave to the tribe of Gad and to his children by their kindreds a possession, of which this is the division.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The border of Jaser, and all the cities of Galaad, and half the land of the children of Ammon: as far as Aroer which is over against Rabba:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And from Hesebon unto Ramoth, Masphe and Betonim: and from Manaim unto the borders of Dabir.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And in the valley Betharan and Bethnemra, and Socoth, and Saphon the other part of the kingdom of Sehon king of Hesebon: the limit of this also is the Jordan, as far as the uttermost part of the sea of Cenereth beyond the Jordan on the east side.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>This is the possession of the children of Gad by their families, their cities, and villages.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>He gave also to the half tribe of Manasses and his children possession according to their kindreds,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>The beginning whereof is this: from Manaim all Basan, and all the kingdoms of Og king of Basan, and all the villages of Jair, which are in Basan, threescore towns.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And half Galaad, and Astaroth, and Edrai, cities of the kingdom of Og in Basan: to the children of Machir, the son of Manasses, to one? half of the children of Machir according to their kindreds.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>This possession Moses divided in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan, over against Jericho on the east side.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>But to the tribe of Levi he gave no possession: because the Lord the God of Israel himself is their possession, as he spoke to them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
