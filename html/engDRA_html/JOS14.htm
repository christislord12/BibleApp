It is forty and five years since the Lord spoke this word to Moses, when Israel journeyed through the wilderness: this day I am eighty-five years old,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>As strong as I was at that time when I was sent to view the land: the strength of that time continueth in me until this day, as well to fight as to march.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Give me therefore this mountain, which the Lord promised, in thy hearing also, wherein are the Enacims, and cities great and strong: if so be the Lord will be with me, and I shall be able to destroy them, as he promised me.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Josue blessed him, and gave him Hebron in possession.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And from that time Hebron belonged to Caleb the son of Jephone the Cenezite, until this present day: because he followed the Lord the God of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The name of Hebron before was called Cariath-Arbe: Adam the greatest among the Enacims was laid there: and the land rested from wars. </div><ul class='tnav'>
