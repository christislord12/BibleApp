And Caleb said to her: What aileth thee?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But she answered: Give me a blessing: thou hast given me a southern and dry land, give me also a land that is watered. And Caleb gave her the upper and the nether watery ground.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>This is the possession of the tribe of the children of Juda by their kindreds.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the cities from the uttermost parts of the children of Juda by the borders of Edom to the south, were Cabseel and Eder and Jagur,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Cina and Dimona and Adada,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Cades and Asor and Jethnam,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Ziph and Telem and Baloth,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>New Asor and Carioth, Hesron, which is Asor.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Amam, Sama and Molada,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Asergadda and Hassemon and Bethphelet,  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Hasersual and Bersabee and Baziothia,  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Baala and Jim and Esem,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Eltholad and Cesil and Harma,  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And Siceleg and Medemena and Sensenna,  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Lebaoth and Selim and Aen and Remmon: all the cities twenty-nine, and their villages.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>But in the plains: Estaol and Sarea and Asena,  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And Zanoe and Engannim and Taphua and Enaim,  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And Jerimoth and Adullam, Socho and Azeca,  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And Saraim and Adithaim and Gedera and Gederothaim: fourteen cities, and their villages.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Sanan and Hadassa and Magdalgad,  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Delean and Masepha and Jecthel,  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Lachis and Bascath and Eglon,  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Chebbon and Leheman and Cethlis,  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And Gideroth and Bethdagon and Naama and Maceda: sixteen cities, and their villages.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Labana and Ether and Asan,  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Jephtha and Esna and Nesib,  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And Ceila and Achzib and Maresa: nine cities, and their villages.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Accaron with the towns and villages thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>From Accaron even to the sea: all places that lie towards Azotus and the villages thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Azotus with its towns and villages.
