And he gave them according to the commandment of the Lord a possession amongst the brethren of their father.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And there fell ten portions to Manasses, beside the land of Galaad and Basan beyond the Jordan.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For the daughters of Manasses possessed inheritance in the midst of his sons. And the land of Galaad fell to the lot of the rest of the children of Manasses.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the border of Manasses was from Aser, Machmethath which looketh towards Sichem: and it goeth out on the right hand by the inhabitants of the fountain of Taphua.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For the lot of Manasses took in the land of Taphua, which is on the borders of Manasses, and belongs to the children of Ephraim.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the border goeth down to the valley of the reeds, to the south of the torrent of the cities of Ephraim, which are in the midst of the cities of Manasses: the border of Manasses is on the north side of the torrent, and the outgoings of it are at the sea:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So that the possession of Ephraim is on the south, and on the north that of Manasses, and the sea is the border of both, and they are joined together in the tribe of Aser on the north, and in the tribe of Issachar on the east.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the inheritance of Manasses in Issachar and in Aser, was Bethsan and its villages, and Jeblaam with its villages, and the inhabitants of Dor, with the towns thereof: the inhabitants also of Endor with the villages thereof: and in like manner the inhabitants of Thenac with the villages thereof: and the inhabitants of Mageddo with their villages, and the third part of the city of Nopheth.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Neither could the children of Manasses overthrow these cities, but the Chanaanite began to dwell in his land.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But after that the children of Israel were grown strong, they subdued the Chanaanites, and made them their tributaries, and they did not kill them.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the children of Joseph spoke to Josue, and said: Why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to possess, whereas I am of so great a multitude, and the Lord hath blessed me?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Josue said to them: If thou be a great people, go up into the woodland, and cut down room for thyself in the land of the Pherezite and the Raphaims: because the possession of mount Ephraim is too narrow for thee.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the children of Joseph answered him: We cannot go up to the mountains, for the Chanaanites that dwell in the low lands, wherein are situate Bethsan with its towns, and Jezrael in the midst of the valley, have chariots of iron.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Josue said to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and Manasses: Thou art a great people, and of great strength, thou shalt not have one lot only:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But thou shalt pass to the mountain, and shalt cut down the wood, and make thyself room to dwell in: and mayst proceed farther, when thou hast destroyed the Chanaanites, who as thou sayest have iron chariots, and are very strong. </div><ul class='tnav'>
