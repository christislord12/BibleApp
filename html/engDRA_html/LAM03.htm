<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 3</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Aleph. I am the man that see my poverty by the rod of his indignation.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Aleph. He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, and not into light.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Aleph. Only against me he hath turned, and turned again his hand all the day.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Beth. My skin and my flesh he hath made old, he hath broken my bones.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Beth. He hath built round about me, and he hath compassed me with gall and labour.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Beth. He hath set me in dark places as those that are dead for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Ghimel. He hath built against me round about, that I may not get out: he hath made my fetters heavy.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Ghimel. Yea, and when I cry, and entreat, he hath shut out my prayer.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Ghimel. He hath shut up my ways with square stones, he hath turned my paths upside down.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Daleth. He is become to me as a bear lying in wait: as a lion in secret places.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Daleth. He hath turned aside my paths, and hath broken me in pieces, he hath made me desolate.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Daleth. He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for his arrows.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He. He hath shot into my reins the daughters of his quiver.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He. I am made a derision to all my people, their song all the day long.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He. He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath inebriated me with wormwood.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Vau. And he hath broken my teeth one by one, he hath fed me with ashes.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Vau. And my soul is removed far off from peace, I have forgotten good things.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Vau. And I said: My end and my hope is perished from the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Zain. Remember my poverty, and transgression, the wormwood, and the gall.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Zain. I will be mindful and remember, and my soul shall languish within me.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Zain. These things I shall think over in my heart, therefore will I hope.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Heth. The mercies of the Lord that we are not consumed: because his commiserations have not failed.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Heth. They are new every morning, great is thy faithfulness.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Heth. The Lord is my portion, said my soul: therefore will I wait for him.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Teth. The Lord is good to them that hope in him, to the soul that seeketh him.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Teth. It is good to wait with silence for the salvation of God.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Teth. It is good for a man, when he hath borne the yoke from his youth.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Jod. He shall sit solitary, and hold his peace: because he hath taken it up upon himself.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Jod. He shall put his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Jod. He shall give his cheek to him that striketh him, he shall be filled with reproaches.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Caph. For the Lord will not cast off for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Caph. For if he hath cast off, he will also have mercy, according to the multitude of his mercies.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Caph. For he hath not willingly afflicted, nor cast off the children of men.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Lamed. To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the land,  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Lamed. To turn aside the judgment of a man before the face of the most High,  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Lamed. To destroy a man wrongfully in his judgment, the Lord hath not approved.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Mem. Who is he that hath commanded a thing to be done, when the Lord commandeth it not?  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Mem. Shall not both evil and good proceed out of the mouth of the Highest?  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Mem. Why hath a living man murmured, man suffering for his sins?  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Nun. Let us search our ways, and seek, and return to the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Nun. Let us lift up our hearts with our hands to the Lord in the heavens.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Nun. We have done wickedly, and provoked thee to wrath: therefore thou art inexorable.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Samech. Thou hast covered in thy wrath, and hast struck us: thou hast killed and hast not spared.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Samech. Thou hast set a cloud before thee, that our prayer may not pass through.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Samech. Thou hast made me as an outcast, and refuse in the midst of the people.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Phe. All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Phe. Prophecy is become to us a fear, and a snare, and destruction.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Phe. My eye hath run down with streams of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Ain. My eye is afflicted, and hath not been quiet, because there was no rest:  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Ain. Till the Lord regarded and looked down from the heavens.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Ain. My eye hath wasted my soul because of all the daughters of my city.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>Sade. My enemies have chased me and caught me like a bird, without cause.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>Sade. My life is fallen into the pit, and they have laid a stone over me.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>Sade. Waters have flowed over my head: I said: I am cut off.  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>Coph. I have called upon thy name, O Lord, from the lowest pit.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>Coph. Thou hast heard my voice: turn not away thy ear from my sighs, and cries.  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>Coph. Thou drewest near in the day, when I called upon thee, thou saidst: Fear not.  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>Res. Thou hast judged, O Lord, the cause of my soul, thou the Redeemer of my life.  <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>Res. Thou hast seen, O Lord, their iniquity against me: judge thou my judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>Res. Thou hast seen all their fury, and all their thoughts against me.  <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>Sin. Thou hast heard their reproach, O Lord, all their imaginations against me.  <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>Sin. The lips of them that rise up against me: and their devices against me all the day.  <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>Sin. Behold their sitting down, and their rising up, I am their song.  <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#160;</span>Thau. Thou shalt render them a recompense, O Lord, according to the works of their hands.  <span class="verse" id="V65">65&#160;</span>Thau. Thou shalt give them a buckler of heart, thy labour.  <span class="verse" id="V66">66&#160;</span>Thau. Thou shalt persecute them in anger, and shalt destroy them from under the heavens, O Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
