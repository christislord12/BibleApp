<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 4</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Aleph. How is the gold become dim, the finest colour is changed, the stones of the sanctuary are scattered in the top of every street?  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Beth. The noble sons of Sion, and they that were clothed with the best gold: how are they esteemed as earthen vessels, the work of the potter’s hands?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Ghimel. Even the sea monsters have drawn out the breast, they have given suck to their young: the daughter of my people is cruel, like the ostrich in the desert.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Daleth. The tongue of the sucking child hath stuck to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the little ones have asked for bread, and there was none to break it unto them.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>He. They that were fed delicately have died in the streets; they that were brought up in scarlet have embraced the dung.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Vau. And the iniquity of the daughter of my people is made greater than the sin of Sodom, which was overthrown in a moment, and hands took nothing in her.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Zain. Her Nazarites were whiter than snow, purer than milk, more ruddy than the old ivory, fairer than the sapphire.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Heth. Their face is now made blacker than coals, and they are not known in the streets: their skin hath stuck to their bones, it is withered, and is become like wood.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Teth. It was better with them that were slain by the sword, than with them that died with hunger: for these pined away being consumed for want of the fruits of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Jod. The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children: they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Caph. The Lord hath accomplished his wrath, he hath poured out his fierce anger: and he hath kindled a fire in Sion, and it hath devoured the foundations thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Lamed. The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world would not have believed, that the adversary and the enemy should enter in by the gates of Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Mem. For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Nun. They have wandered as blind men in the streets, they were defiled with blood: and when they could not help walking in it, they held up their skirts.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Samech. Depart you that are defiled, they cried out to them: Depart, get ye hence, touch not: for they quarrelled, and being removed, they said among the Gentiles: He will no more dwell among them.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Phe. The face of the Lord hath divided them, he will no more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, neither had they pity on the ancient.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Ain. While we were yet standing, our eyes failed, expecting help for us in vain, when we looked attentively towards a nation that was not able to save.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Sade. Our steps have slipped in the way of our streets, our end draweth near: our days are fulfilled, for our end is come.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Coph. Our persecutors were swifter than the eagles of the air: they pursued us upon the mountains, they lay in wait for us in the wilderness.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Res. The breath of our mouth, Christ the Lord, is taken in our sins: to whom we said: Under thy shadow we shall live among the Gentiles.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Sin. Rejoice, and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Hus: to thee also shall the cup come, thou shalt be made drunk, and naked.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Thau. Thy iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Sion, he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he visited thy iniquity, O daughter of Edom, he hath discovered thy sins. The Prayer of Jeremias the Prophet. </div><ul class='tnav'>
