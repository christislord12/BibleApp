And the priest shall offer it all and burn it all upon the altar for a holocaust, and most sweet savour to the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But if the oblation of a holocaust to the Lord be of birds, of turtles, or of young pigeons,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The priest shall offer it at the altar: and twisting back the neck, and breaking the place of the wound, he shall make the blood run down upon the brim of the altar.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But the crop of the throat, and the feathers he shall cast beside the altar at the east side, in the place where the ashes are wont to be poured out,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he shall break the pinions thereof, and shall not cut, nor divide it with a knife, and shall burn it upon the altar, putting fire under the wood. It is a holocaust and oblation of most sweet savour to the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
