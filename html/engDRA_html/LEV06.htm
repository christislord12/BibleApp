It shall be most holy, as that which is offered for sin and for trespass.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The males only of the race of Aaron shall eat it. It shall be an ordinance everlasting in your generations concerning the sacrifices of the Lord: Every one that toucheth them shall be sanctified.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>This is the oblation of Aaron, and of his sons, which they must offer to the Lord, in the day of their anointing: They shall offer the tenth part of an ephi of flour for a perpetual sacrifice, half of it in the morning, and half of it in the evening:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>It shall be tempered with oil, and shall be fried in a fryingpan.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the priest that rightfully succeedeth his father, shall offer it hot, for a most sweet odour to the Lord, and it shall be wholly burnt on the altar.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For every sacrifice of the priest shall be consumed with fire, neither shall any man eat thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Say to Aaron and his sons: This is the law of the victim for sin: in the place where the holocaust is offered, it shall be immolated before the Lord. It is holy of holies.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>The priest that offereth it, shall eat it in a holy place, in the court of the tabernacle.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof, shall be sanctified. If a garment be sprinkled with the blood thereof, it shall be washed in a holy place.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the earthen vessel, wherein it was sodden, shall be broken, but if the vessel be of brass, it shall be scoured, and washed with water.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Every male of the priestly race shall eat of the flesh thereof, because it is holy of holies.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For the victim that is slain for sin, the blood of which is carried into the tabernacle of the testimony to make atonement in the sanctuary, shall not be eaten, but shall be burnt with fire. </div><ul class='tnav'>
