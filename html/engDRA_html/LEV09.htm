And after the fat was burnt upon the altar,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Aaron separated their breasts, and the right shoulders, elevating them before the Lord, as Moses had commanded.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And stretching forth his hands to the people, he blessed them. And so the victims for sin, and the holocausts, and the peace offerings being finished, he came down.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the testimony, and afterwards came forth and blessed the people. And the glory of the Lord appeared to all the multitude:  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And behold a fire, coming forth from the Lord, devoured the holocaust, and the fat that was upon the altar: which when the multitude saw, they praised the Lord, falling on their faces. </div><ul class='tnav'>
