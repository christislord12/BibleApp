All that hath fins, and scales, as well in the sea, as in the rivers, and the pools, you shall eat.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But whatsoever hath not fins and scales, of those things that move and live in the waters, shall be an abomination to you,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And detestable: their flesh you shall not eat, and their carcasses you shall avoid.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>All that have not fins and scales, in the waters, shall be unclean.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Of birds these are they which you must not eat, and which are to be avoided by you: The eagle, and the griffon, and the osprey,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the kite, and the vulture, according to their kind,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And all that is of the raven kind, according to their likeness.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The ostrich, and the owl, and the larus, and the hawk according to its kind.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The screech owl, and the cormorant, and the ibis,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the swan, and the bittern, and the porphyrion,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The heron, and the charadrion according to its kind, the houp also, and the bat.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Of things that fly, whatsoever goeth upon four feet, shall be abominable to you.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But whatsoever walketh upon four feet, but hath the legs behind longer, wherewith it hoppeth upon the earth,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>That you shall eat, as the bruchus in its kind, the attacus, and ophiomachus, and the locust, every one according to their kind.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But of dying things whatsoever hath four feet only, shall be an abomination to you:  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And whosoever shall touch the carcasses of them, shall be defiled, and shall be unclean until the evening:  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And if it be necessary that he carry any of these things when they are dead, he shall wash his clothes, and shall be unclean until the sun set.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Every beast that hath a hoof, but divideth it not, nor cheweth the cud, shall be unclean: and he that toucheth it, shall be defiled.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>That which walketh upon hands of all animals which go on all four, shall be unclean: he that shall touch their carcasses shall be defiled until evening.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And he that shall carry such carcasses, shall wash his clothes, and shall be unclean until evening: because all these things are unclean to you.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>These also shall be reckoned among unclean things, of all that move upon the earth, the weasel, and the mouse, and the crocodile, every one according to their kind:  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>The shrew, and the chameleon, and the stello, and the lizard, and the mole:  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>All these are unclean. He that toucheth their carcasses shall be unclean until the evening.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And upon what thing soever any of their carcasses shall fall, it shall be defiled, whether it be a vessel of wood, or a garment, or skins or haircloths; or any thing in which work is done, they shall be dipped in water, and shall be unclean until the evening, and so afterwards shall be clean.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>But an earthen vessel, into which any of these shall fall, shall be defiled, and therefore is to be broken.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Any meat which you eat, if water from such a vessel be poured upon it, shall be unclean; and every liquor that is drunk out of any such vessel, shall be unclean.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And upon whatsoever thing any of these dead beasts shall fall, it shall be unclean: whether it be oven, or pots with feet, they shall be destroyed, and shall be unclean.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>But fountains and cisterns, and all gatherings together of waters shall be clean. He that toucheth their carcasses shall be defiled.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>If it fall upon seed corn, it shall not defile it.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>But if any man pour water upon the seed, and afterwards it be touched by the carcasses, it shall be forthwith defiled.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>If any beast die, of which it is lawful for you to eat, he that toucheth the carcass thereof, shall be unclean until the evening:  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And he that eateth or carrieth any thing thereof, shall wash his clothes, and shall be unclean until the evening.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>All that creepeth upon the earth shall be abominable, neither shall it be taken for meat.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Whatsoever goeth upon the breast on four feet, or hath many feet, or traileth on the earth, you shall not eat, because it is abominable.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Do not defile your souls, nor touch aught thereof, lest you be unclean,  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>For I am the Lord your God: be holy because I am holy. Defile not your souls by any creeping thing, that moveth upon the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>For I am the Lord, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that I might be your God.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>You shall be holy, because I am holy. This is the law of beasts and fowls, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and creepeth on the earth:  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>That you may know the differences of the clean, and unclean, and know what you ought to eat, and what to refuse. </div><ul class='tnav'>
