She shall touch no holy thing, neither shall she enter into the sanctuary, until the days of her purification be fulfilled.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But if she shall bear a maid child, she shall be unclean two weeks, according to the custom of her monthly courses, and she shall remain in the blood of her purification sixty-six days.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And when the days of her purification are expired, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring to the door of the tabernacle of the testimony, a lamb of a year old for a holocaust, and a young pigeon or a turtle for sin, and shall deliver them to the priest:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Who shall offer them before the Lord, and shall pray for her, and so she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This is the law for her that beareth a man child or a maid child.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And if her hand find not sufficiency, and she is not able to offer a lamb, she shall take two turtles, or two young pigeons, one for a holocaust, and another for sin: and the priest shall pray for her, and so she shall be cleansed. </div><ul class='tnav'>
