According to this rite shall he do to the tabernacle of the testimony, which is fixed among them in the midst of the filth of their habitation.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Let no man be in the tabernacle when the high priest goeth into the sanctuary, to pray for himself and his house, and for the whole congregation of Israel, until he come out.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And when he is come out to the altar that is before the Lord, let him pray for himself, and taking the blood of the calf, and of the buck goat, let him pour it upon the horns thereof round about:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And sprinkling with his finger seven times, let him expiate, and sanctify it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>After he hath cleansed the sanctuary, and the tabernacle, and the altar, then let him offer the living goat:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And putting both hands upon his head, let him confess all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their offences and sins: and praying that they may light on his head, he shall turn him out by a man ready for it, into the desert.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And when the goat hath carried all their iniquities into an uninhabited land, and shall be let go into the desert,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Aaron shall return into the tabernacle of the testimony, and putting off the vestments, which he had on him before when he entered into the sanctuary, and leaving them there,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>He shall wash his flesh in the holy place, and shall put on his own garments. And after that he has come out and hath offered his own holocaust, and that of the people, he shall pray both for himself, and for the people:  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And the fat that is offered for sins, he shall burn upon the altar.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But he that hath let go the emissary goat, shall wash his clothes, and his body with water, and so shall enter into the camp.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But the calf and the buck goat, that were sacrificed for sin, and whose blood was carried into the sanctuary, to accomplish the atonement, they shall carry forth without the camp, and shall burn with fire, their skins and their flesh, and their dung:  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And whosoever burneth them shall wash his clothes, and flesh with water, and so shall enter into the camp.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And this shall be to you an everlasting ordinance: The seventh month, the tenth day of the month, you shall afflict your souls, and shall do no work, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger that sojourneth among you.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Upon this day shall be the expiation for you, and the cleansing from all your sins: you shall be cleansed before the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For it is a sabbath of rest, and you shall afflict your souls by a perpetual religion.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the priest that is anointed, and whose hands are consecrated to do the office of the priesthood in his father’s stead, shall make atonement; and he shall be vested with the linen robe and the holy vestments,  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And he shall expiate the sanctuary and the tabernacle of the testimony and the altar, the priest also and all the people.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And this shall be an ordinance for ever, that you pray for the children of Israel, and for all their sins once in a year. He did therefore as the Lord had commanded Moses. </div><ul class='tnav'>
