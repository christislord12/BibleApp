It shall be an ordinance for ever to them and to their posterity.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And thou shalt say to them: The man of the house of Israel, and of the strangers who sojourn among you, that offereth a holocaust or a victim,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And bringeth it not to the door of the tabernacle of the testimony, that it may be offered to the Lord, shall perish from among his people.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>If any man whosoever of the house of Israel, and of the strangers that sojourn among them, eat blood, I will set my face against his soul, and will cut him off from among his people:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Because the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you, that you may make atonement with it upon the altar for your souls, and the blood may be for an expiation of the soul.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Therefore I have said to the children of Israel: No soul of you, nor of the strangers that sojourn among you, shall eat blood.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Any man whosoever of the children of Israel, and of the strangers that sojourn among you, if by hunting or fowling, he take a wild beast or a bird, which is lawful to eat, let him pour out its blood, and cover it with earth.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For the life of all flesh is in the blood: therefore I said to the children of Israel: You shall not eat the blood of any flesh at all, because the life of the flesh is in the blood, and whosoever eateth it, shall be cut off.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The soul that eateth that which died of itself, or has been caught by a beast, whether he be one of your own country or a stranger, shall wash his clothes and himself with water, and shall be defiled until the evening: and in this manner he shall be made clean.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But if he do not wash his clothes, and his body, he shall bear his iniquity. </div><ul class='tnav'>
