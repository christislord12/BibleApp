I am the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Keep my laws and my judgments, which if a man do, he shall live in them. I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>No man shall approach to her that is near of kin to him, to uncover her nakedness. I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother: she is thy mother, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s wife: for it is the nakedness of thy father.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy sister by father or by mother, whether born at home or abroad.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy son’s daughter, or thy daughter’s daughter: because it is thy own nakedness.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s wife’s daughter, whom she bore to thy father, and who is thy sister.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s sister: because she is the flesh of thy father.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother’s sister: because she is thy mother’s flesh.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s brother: neither shalt thou approach to his wife, who is joined to thee by affinity.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law: because she is thy son’s wife, neither shalt thou discover her shame.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother’s wife: because it is the nakedness of thy brother.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy wife and her daughter. Thou shalt not take her son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter, to discover her shame: because they are her flesh, and such copulation is incest.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Thou shalt not take thy wife’s sister for a harlot, to rival her, neither shalt thou discover her nakedness, while she is yet living.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Thou shalt not approach to a woman having her flowers, neither shalt thou uncover her nakedness.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Thou shalt not lie with thy neighbour’s wife, nor be defiled with mingling of seed.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Thou shalt not give any of thy seed to be consecrated to the idol Moloch, nor defile the name of thy God: I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Thou shalt not lie with mankind as with womankind, because it is an abomination.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Thou shalt not copulate with any beast, neither shalt thou be defiled with it. A woman shall not lie down to a beast, nor copulate with it: because it is a heinous crime.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Defile not yourselves with any of these things with which all the nations have been defiled, which I will cast out before you,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And with which the land is defiled: the abominations of which I will visit, that it may vomit out its inhabitants.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Keep ye my ordinances and my judgments, and do not any of these abominations: neither any of your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For all these detestable things the inhabitants of the land have done, that; were before you, and have defiled it.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Beware then, lest in like manner, it vomit you also out, if you do the like things, as it vomited out the nation that was before you.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Every soul that shall commit any of these abominations, shall perish from the midst of his people.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Keep my commandments. Do not the things which they have done, that have been before you, and be not defiled therein. I am the Lord your God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
