And Aaron shall set them from evening until morning before the Lord, by a perpetual service and rite in your generations.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>They shall be set upon the most pure candlestick before the Lord continually.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Thou shalt take also fine hour, and shalt bake twelve leaves thereof, two tenths shall be in every loaf:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And thou shalt set them six and six one against another upon the most clean table before the Lord:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And thou shalt put upon them the dearest frankincense, that the bread may be for a memorial of the oblation of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Every sabbath they shall be changed before the Lord, being received of the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And they shall be Aaron’s and his sons’, that they may eat them in the holy place: because it is most holy of the sacrifices of the Lord by a perpetual right.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And behold there went out the son of a woman of Israel, whom she had of an Egyptian, among the children of Israel, and fell at words in the camp with a man of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And when he had blasphemed the name, and had cursed it, he was brought to Moses: (now his mother was called Salumith, the daughter of Dabri, of the tribe of Dan:)  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And they put him into prison, till they might know what the Lord would command.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the Lord spoke to Moses,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Saying: Bring forth the blasphemer without the camp, and let them that heard him, put their hands upon his head, and let all the people stone him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And thou shalt speak to the children of Israel: the man that curseth his God, shall bear his sin:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, dying let him die: all the multitude shall stone him, whether he be a native or a stranger. He that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, dying let him die.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He that striketh and killeth a man, dying let him die.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>He that killeth a beast, shall make it good, that is to say, shall give beast for beast.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>He that giveth a blemish to any of his neighbours: as he hath done, so shall it be done to him:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, shall he restore. What blemish he gave, the like shall he be compelled to suffer.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>He that striketh a beast, shall render another. He that striketh a man shall be punished.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Let there be equal judgment among you, whether he be a stranger, or a native that offends: because I am the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Moses spoke to the children of Israel: and they brought forth him that had blasphemed, without the camp, and they stoned him. And the children of Israel did as the Lord had commanded Moses. </div><ul class='tnav'>
