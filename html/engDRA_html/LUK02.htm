You shall find the infant wrapped in swaddling clothes, and laid in a manger.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army, praising God, and saying:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Glory to God in the highest; and on earth peace to men of good will.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And it came to pass, after the angels departed from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another: Let us go over to Bethlehem, and let us see this word that is come to pass, which the Lord hath shewed to us.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And they came with haste; and they found Mary and Joseph, and the infant lying in the manger.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And seeing, they understood of the word that had been spoken to them concerning this child.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And all that heard, wondered; and at those things that were told them by the shepherds.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But Mary kept all these words, pondering them in her heart.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God, for all the things they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And after eight days were accomplished, that the child should be circumcised, his name was called JESUS, which was called by the angel, before he was conceived in the womb.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And after the days of her purification, according to the law of Moses, were accomplished, they carried him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>As it is written in the law of the Lord: Every male opening the womb shall be called holy to the Lord:  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And to offer a sacrifice, according as it is written in the law of the Lord, a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons:  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And behold there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon, and this man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel; and the Holy Ghost was in him.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And he had received an answer from the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Christ of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And he came by the Spirit into the temple. And when his parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the law,  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>He also took him into his arms, and blessed God, and said:  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Now thou dost dismiss thy servant, O Lord, according to thy word in peace;  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Because my eyes have seen thy salvation,  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples:  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>A light to the revelation of the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And his father and mother were wondering at those things which were spoken concerning him.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother: Behold this child is set for the fall, and for the resurrection of many in Israel, and for a sign which shall be contradicted;  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And thy own soul a sword shall pierce, that, out of many hearts, thoughts may be revealed.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser; she was far advanced in years, and had lived with her husband seven years from her virginity.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And she was a widow until fourscore and four years; who departed not from the temple, by fastings and prayers serving night and day.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Now she, at the same hour, coming in, confessed to the Lord; and spoke of him to all that looked for the redemption of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And after they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their city Nazareth.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And the child grew, and waxed strong, full of wisdom; and the grace of God was in him.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And his parents went every year to Jerusalem, at the solemn day of the pasch,  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And when he was twelve years old, they going up into Jerusalem, according to the custom of the feast,  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And having fulfilled the days, when they returned, the child Jesus remained in Jerusalem; and his parents knew it not.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And thinking that he was in the company, they came a day’s journey, and sought him among their kinsfolks and acquaintance.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And not finding him, they returned into Jerusalem, seeking him.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And it came to pass, that, after three days, they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, hearing them, and asking them questions.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And all that heard him were astonished at his wisdom and his answers.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>And seeing him, they wondered. And his mother said to him: Son, why hast thou done so to us? behold thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>And he said to them: How is it that you sought me? did you not know, that I must be about my father’s business?  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>And they understood not the word that he spoke unto them.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them. And his mother kept all these words in her heart.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>And Jesus advanced in wisdom, and age, and grace with God and men. </div><ul class='tnav'>
