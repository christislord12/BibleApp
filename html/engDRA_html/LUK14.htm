<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 14</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when Jesus went into the house of one of the chief of the Pharisees, on the sabbath day, to eat bread, that they watched him.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And behold, there was a certain man before him that had the dropsy.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And Jesus answering, spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying: Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But they held their peace. But he taking him, healed him, and sent him away.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And answering them, he said: Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fall into a pit, and will not immediately draw him out, on the sabbath day?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And they could not answer him to these things.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And he spoke a parable also to them that were invited, marking how they chose the first seats at the table, saying to them:  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>When thou art invited to a wedding, sit not down in the first place, lest perhaps one more honourable than thou be invited by him:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he that invited thee and him, come and say to thee, Give this man place: and then thou begin with shame to take the lowest place.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But when thou art invited, go, sit down in the lowest place; that when he who invited thee, cometh, he may say to thee: Friend, go up higher. Then shalt thou have glory before them that sit at table with thee.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Because every one that exalteth himself, shall be humbled; and he that humbleth himself, shall be exalted.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he said to him also that had invited him: When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, nor thy kinsmen, nor thy neighbours who are rich; lest perhaps they also invite thee again, and a recompense be made to thee.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind;  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And thou shalt be blessed, because they have not wherewith to make thee recompense: for recompense shall be made thee at the resurrection of the just.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>When one of them that sat at table with him, had heard these things, he said to him: Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But he said to him: A certain man made a great supper, and invited many.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he sent his servant at the hour of supper to say to them that were invited, that they should come, for now all things are ready.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And they began all at once to make excuse. The first said to him: I have bought a farm, and I must needs go out and see it: I pray thee, hold me excused.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And another said: I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to try them: I pray thee, hold me excused.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And another said: I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the servant returning, told these things to his lord. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant: Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the feeble, and the blind, and the lame.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the servant said: Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the Lord said to the servant: Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But I say unto you, that none of those men that were invited, shall taste of my supper.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And there went great multitudes with him. And turning, he said to them:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And whosoever doth not carry his cross and come after me, cannot be my disciple.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For which of you having a mind to build a tower, doth not first sit down, and reckon the charges that are necessary, whether he have wherewithal to finish it:  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Lest, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that see it begin to mock him,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Saying: This man began to build, and was not able to finish.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Or what king, about to go to make war against another king, doth not first sit down, and think whether he be able, with ten thousand, to meet him that, with twenty thousand, cometh against him?  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Or else, whilst the other is yet afar off, sending an embassy, he desireth conditions of peace.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>So likewise every one of you that doth not renounce all that he possesseth, cannot be my disciple.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Salt is good. But if the salt shall lose its savour, wherewith shall it be seasoned?  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>It is neither profitable for the land nor for the dunghill, but shall be cast out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. </div><ul class='tnav'>
