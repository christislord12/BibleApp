<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 15</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Now the publicans and sinners drew near unto him to hear him.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying: This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And he spoke to them this parable, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>What man of you that hath an hundred sheep: and if he shall lose one of them, doth he not leave the ninety-nine in the desert, and go after that which was lost, until he find it?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And when he hath found it, lay it upon his shoulders, rejoicing:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And coming home, call together his friends and neighbours, saying to them: Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I say to you, that even so there shall be joy in heaven upon one sinner that doth penance, more than upon ninety-nine just who need not penance.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Or what woman having ten groats; if she lose one groat, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently until she find it?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And when she hath found it, call together her friends and neighbours, saying: Rejoice with me, because I have found the groat which I had lost.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So I say to you, there shall be joy before the angels of God upon one sinner doing penance.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And he said: A certain man had two sons:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the younger of them said to his father: Father, give me the portion of substance that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his substance.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And not many days after, the younger son, gathering all together, went abroad into a far country: and there wasted his substance, living riotously.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And after he had spent all, there came a mighty famine in that country; and he began to be in want.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he went and cleaved to one of the citizens of that country. And he sent him into his farm to feed swine.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks the swine did eat; and no man gave unto him.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And returning to himself, he said: How many hired servants in my father’s house abound with bread, and I here perish with hunger?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I will arise, and will go to my father, and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>I am not worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And rising up he came to his father. And when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and running to him fell upon his neck, and kissed him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the son said to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, I am not now worthy to be called thy son.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the father said to his servants: Bring forth quickly the first robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it, and let us eat and make merry:  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Because this my son was dead, and is come to life again: was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Now his elder son was in the field, and when he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And he said to him: Thy brother is come, and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And he was angry, and would not go in. His father therefore coming out began to entreat him.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And he answering, said to his father: Behold, for so many years do I serve thee, and I have never transgressed thy commandment, and yet thou hast never given me a kid to make merry with my friends:  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But as soon as this thy son is come, who hath devoured his substance with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>But he said to him: Son, thou art always with me, and all I have is thine.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But it was fit that we should make merry and be glad, for this thy brother was dead and is come to life again; he was lost, and is found. </div><ul class='tnav'>
