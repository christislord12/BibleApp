<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 16</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And he said also to his disciples: There was a certain rich man who had a steward: and the same was accused unto him, that he had wasted his goods.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And he called him, and said to him: How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship: for now thou canst be steward no longer.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And the steward said within himself: What shall I do, because my lord taketh away from me the stewardship? To dig I am not able; to beg I am ashamed.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I know what I will do, that when I shall be removed from the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Therefore calling together every one of his lord’s debtors, he said to the first: How much dost thou owe my lord?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But he said: An hundred barrels of oil. And he said to him: Take thy bill and sit down quickly, and write fifty.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then he said to another: And how much dost thou owe? Who said: An hundred quarters of wheat. He said to him: Take thy bill, and write eighty.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the lord commended the unjust steward, forasmuch as he had done wisely: for the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And I say to you: Make unto you friends of the mammon of iniquity; that when you shall fail, they may receive you into everlasting dwellings.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He that is faithful in that which is least, is faithful also in that which is greater: and he that is unjust in that which is little, is unjust also in that which is greater.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>If then you have not been faithful in the unjust mammon; who will trust you with that which is the true?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And if you have not been faithful in that which is another’s; who will give you that which is your own?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or he will hold to the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Now the Pharisees, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he said to them: You are they who justify yourselves before men, but God knoweth your hearts; for that which is high to men, is an abomination before God.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The law and the prophets were until John; from that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every one useth violence towards it.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fall.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Every one that putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth her that is put away from her husband, committeth adultery.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>There was a certain rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen; and feasted sumptuously every day.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And there was a certain beggar, named Lazarus, who lay at his gate, full of sores,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Desiring to be filled with the crumbs that fell from the rich man’s table, and no one did give him; moreover the dogs came, and licked his sores.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham’s bosom. And the rich man also died: and he was buried in hell.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And lifting up his eyes when he was in torments, he saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom:  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he cried, and said: Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, to cool my tongue: for I am tormented in this flame.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Abraham said to him: Son, remember that thou didst receive good things in thy lifetime, and likewise Lazareth evil things, but now he is comforted; and thou art tormented.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And besides all this, between us and you, there is fixed a great chaos: so that they who would pass from hence to you, cannot, nor from thence come hither.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And he said: Then, father, I beseech thee, that thou wouldst send him to my father’s house, for I have five brethren,  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>That he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torments.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Abraham said to him: They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But he said: No, father Abraham: but if one went to them from the dead, they will do penance.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And he said to him: If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they believe, if one rise again from the dead. </div><ul class='tnav'>
