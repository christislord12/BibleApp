<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 17</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And he said to his disciples: It is impossible that scandals should not come: but woe to him through whom they come.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>It were better for him, that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should scandalize one of these little ones.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Take heed to yourselves. If thy brother sin against thee, reprove him: and if he do penance, forgive him.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And if he sin against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day be converted unto thee, saying, I repent; forgive him.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the apostles said to the Lord: Increase our faith.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the Lord said: If you had faith like to a grain of mustard seed, you might say to this mulberry tree, Be thou rooted up, and be thou transplanted into the sea: and it would obey you.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But which of you having a servant ploughing, or feeding cattle, will say to him, when he is come from the field: Immediately go, sit down to meat:  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And will not rather say to him: Make ready my supper, and gird thyself, and serve me, whilst I eat and drink, and afterwards thou shalt eat and drink?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Doth he thank that servant, for doing the things which he commanded him?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I think not. So you also, when you shall have done all these things that are commanded you, say: We are unprofitable servants; we have done that which we ought to do.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And it came to pass, as he was going to Jerusalem, he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And as he entered into a certain town, there met him ten men that were lepers, who stood afar off;  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And lifted up their voice, saying: Jesus, master, have mercy on us.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Whom when he saw, he said: Go, shew yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass, as they went, they were made clean.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And one of them, when he saw that he was made clean, went back, with a loud voice glorifying God.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And he fell on his face before his feet, giving thanks: and this was a Samaritan.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Jesus answering, said, Were not ten made clean? and where are the nine?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>There is no one found to return and give glory to God, but this stranger.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he said to him: Arise, go thy way; for thy faith hath made thee whole.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And being asked by the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come? he answered them, and said: The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Neither shall they say: Behold here, or behold there. For lo, the kingdom of God is within you.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And he said to his disciples: The days will come, when you shall desire to see one day of the Son of man; and you shall not see it.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And they will say to you: See here, and see there. Go ye not after, nor follow them:  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For as the lightening that lighteneth from under heaven, shineth unto the parts that are under heaven, so shall the Son of man be in his day.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But first he must suffer many things, and be rejected by this generation.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And as it came to pass in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>They did eat and drink, they married wives, and were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark: and the flood came and destroyed them all.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Likewise as it came to pass, in the days of Lot: they did eat and drink, they bought and sold, they planted and built.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And in the day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man shall be revealed.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>In that hour, he that shall be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away: and he that shall be in the field, in like manner, let him not return back.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Remember Lot’s wife.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Whosoever shall seek to save his life, shall lose it: and whosoever shall lose it, shall preserve it.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>I say to you: in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Two women shall be grinding together: the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left: two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be keft.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>They answering, say to him: Where, Lord?  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Who said to them: Wheresoever the body shall be, thither will the eagles also be gathered together. </div><ul class='tnav'>
