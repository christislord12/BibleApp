<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 18</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And he spoke also a parable to them, that we ought always to pray, and not to faint,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Saying: There was a judge in a certain city, who feared not God, nor regarded man.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And there was a certain widow in that city, and she came to him, saying: Avenge me of my adversary.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And he would not for a long time. But afterwards he said within himself: Although I fear not God, nor regard man,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Yet because this widow is troublesome to me, I will avenge her, lest continually coming she weary me.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the Lord said: Hear what the unjust judge saith.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And will not God revenge his elect who cry to him day and night: and will he have patience in their regard?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I say to you, that he will quickly revenge them. But yet the Son of man, when he cometh, shall he find, think you, faith on earth?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And to some who trusted in themselves as just, and despised others, he spoke also this parable:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Two men went up into the temple to pray: the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The Pharisee standing, prayed thus with himself: O God, I give thee thanks that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, as also is this publican.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I fast twice in a week: I give tithes of all that I possess.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the publican, standing afar off, would not so much as lift up his eyes towards heaven; but struck his breast, saying: O god, be merciful to me a sinner.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I say to you, this man went down into his house justified rather that the other: because every one that exalteth himself, shall be humbled: and he that humbleth himself, shall be exalted.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And they brought unto him also infants, that he might touch them. Which when the disciples saw, they rebuked them.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But Jesus, calling them together, said: Suffer children to come to me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Amen, I say to you: Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a child, shall not enter into it.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And a certain ruler asked him, saying: Good master, what shall I do to possess everlasting life?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Jesus said to him: Why dost thou call me good? None is good but God alone.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Thou knowest the commandments: Thou shalt not kill: Thou shalt not commit adultery: Thou shalt not steal: Thou shalt not bear false witness: Honour thy father and mother.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Who said: All these things have I kept from my youth.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Which when Jesus had heard, he said to him: Yet one thing is wanting to thee: sell all whatever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>He having heard these things, became sorrowful; for he was very rich.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Jesus seeing him become sorrowful, said: How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And they that heard it, said: Who then can be saved?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>He said to them: The things that are impossible with men, are possible with God.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then Peter said: Behold, we have left all things, and have followed thee.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Who said to them: Amen, I say to you, there is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God’s sake,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Who shall not receive much more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then Jesus took unto him the twelve, and said to them: Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things shall be accomplished which were written by the prophets concerning the Son of man.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and scourged, and spit upon:  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And after they have scourged him, they will put him to death; and the third day he shall rise again.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And they understood none of these things, and this word was hid from them, and they understood not the things that were said.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Now it came to pass, when he drew nigh to Jericho, that a certain blind man sat by the way side, begging.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And when he heard the multitude passing by, he asked what this meant.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And he cried out, saying: Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And they that went before, rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out much more: Son of David, have mercy on me.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And Jesus standing, commanded him to be brought unto him. And when he was come near, he asked him,  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Saying: What wilt thou that I do to thee? But he said: Lord, that I may see.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And Jesus said to him: Receive thy sight: thy faith hath made thee whole.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And immediately he saw, and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
