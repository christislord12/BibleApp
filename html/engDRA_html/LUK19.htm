Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up what I laid not down, and reaping that which I did not sow:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And why then didst thou not give my money into the bank, that at my coming, I might have exacted it with usury?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he said to them that stood by: Take the pound away from him, and give it to him that hath ten pounds.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And they said to him: Lord, he hath ten pounds.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But I say to you, that to every one that hath shall be given, and he shall abound: and from him that hath not, even that which he hath, shall be taken from him.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But as for those my enemies, who would not have me reign over them, bring them hither, and kill them before me.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And having said these things, he went before, going up to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethania, unto the mount called Olivet, he sent two of his disciples,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Saying: Go into the town which is over against you, at your entering into which you shall find the colt of an ass tied, on which no man ever hath sitten: loose him, and bring him hither.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And if any man shall ask you: Why do you loose him? you shall say thus unto him: Because the Lord hath need of his service.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And they that were sent, went their way, and found the colt standing, as he had said unto them.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said to them: Why loose you the colt?  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But they said: Because the Lord hath need of him.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And they brought him to Jesus. And casting their garments on the colt, they set Jesus thereon.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And as he went, they spread their clothes underneath in the way.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And when he was now coming near the descent of mount Olivet, the whole multitude of his disciples began with joy to praise God with a loud voice, for all the mighty works they had seen,  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Saying: Blessed be the king who cometh in the name of the Lord, peace in heaven, and glory on high!  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And some of the Pharisees, from amongst the multitude, said to him: Master, rebuke thy disciples.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>To whom he said: I say to you, that if these shall hold their peace, the stones will cry out.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And when he drew near, seeing the city, he wept over it, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>If thou also hadst known, and that in this thy day, the things that are to thy peace; but now they are hidden from thy eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>For the days shall come upon thee, and thy enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and straiten thee on every side,  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And beat thee flat to the ground, and thy children who are in thee: and they shall not leave in thee a stone upon a stone: because thou hast not known the time of thy visitation.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And entering into the temple, he began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Saying to them: It is written: My house is the house of prayer. But you have made it a den of thieves.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And he was teaching daily in the temple. And the chief priests and the scribes and the rulers of the people sought to destroy him:  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>And they found not what to do to him: for all the people were very attentive to hear him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
