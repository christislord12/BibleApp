For the powers of heaven shall be moved;  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And then they shall see the Son of man coming in a cloud, with great power and majesty.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But when these things begin to come to pass, look up, and lift up your heads, because your redemption is at hand.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And he spoke to them in a similitude. See the fig tree, and all the trees:  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>When they now shoot forth their fruit, you know that summer is nigh;  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>So you also, when you shall see these things come to pass, know that the kingdom of God is at hand.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Amen, I say to you, this generation shall not pass away, till all things be fulfilled.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And take heed to yourselves, lest perhaps your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and the cares of this life, and that day come upon you suddenly.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>For as a snare shall it come upon all that sit upon the face of the whole earth.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Watch ye, therefore, praying at all times, that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that are to come, and to stand before the Son of man.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And in the daytime, he was teaching in the temple; but at night, going out, he abode in the mount that is called Olivet.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, to hear him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
