<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 22</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the pasch, was at hand.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put Jesus to death: but they feared the people.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And Satan entered into Judas, who was surnamed Iscariot, one of the twelve.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And he went, and discoursed with the chief priests and the magistrates, how he might betray him to them.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And he promised. And he sought opportunity to betray him in the absence of the multitude.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the day of the unleavened bread came, on which it was necessary that the pasch should be killed.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And he sent Peter and John, saying: Go, and prepare for us the pasch, that we may eat.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But they said: Where wilt thou that we prepare?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And he said to them: Behold, as you go into the city, there shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water: follow him into the house where he entereth in.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And you shall say to the goodman of the house: The master saith to thee, Where is the guest chamber, where I may eat the pasch with my disciples?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he will shew you a large dining room, furnished; and there prepare.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And they going, found as he had said to them, and made ready the pasch.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he said to them: With desire I have desired to eat this pasch with you, before I suffer.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For I say to you, that from this time I will not eat it, till it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And having taken the chalice, he gave thanks, and said: Take, and divide it among you:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For I say to you, that I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, till the kingdom of God come.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And taking bread, he gave thanks, and brake; and gave to them, saying: This is my body, which is given for you. Do this for a commemoration of me.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>In like manner the chalice also, after he had supped, saying: This is the chalice, the new testament in my blood, which shall be shed for you.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But yet behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the Son of man indeed goeth, according to that which is determined: but yet, woe to that man by whom he shall be betrayed.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And they began to inquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And there was also a strife amongst them, which of them should seem to be the greater.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And he said to them: The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and they that have power over them, are called beneficent.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But you not so: but he that is the greater among you, let him become as the younger; and he that is the leader, as he that serveth.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For which is greater, he that sitteth at table, or he that serveth? Is it not he that sitteth at table? But I am in the midst of you, as he that serveth:  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And you are they who have continued with me in my temptations:  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And I dispose to you, as my Father hath disposed to me, a kingdom;  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>That you may eat and drink at my table, in my kingdom: and may sit upon thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And the Lord said: Simon, Simon, behold Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and thou, being once converted, confirm thy brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Who said to him: Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And he said: I say to thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, till thou thrice deniest that thou knowest me. And he said to them:  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, did you want anything?  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>But they said: Nothing. Then said he unto them: But now he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise a scrip; and he that hath not, let him sell his coat, and buy a sword.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>For I say to you, that this that is written must yet be fulfilled in me: And with the wicked was he reckoned. For the things concerning me have an end.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>But they said: Lord, behold here are two swords. And he said to them, It is enough.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And going out, he went, according to his custom, to the mount of Olives. And his disciples also followed him.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And when he was come to the place, he said to them: Pray, lest ye enter into temptation.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And he was withdrawn away from them a stone’s cast; and kneeling down, he prayed,  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Saying: Father, if thou wilt, remove this chalice from me: but yet not my will, but thine be done.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him. And being in an agony, he prayed the longer.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And his sweat became as drops of blood, trickling down upon the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And he said to them: Why sleep you? arise, pray, lest you enter into temptation.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>As he was yet speaking, behold a multitude; and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near to Jesus, for to kiss him.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>And Jesus said to him: Judas, dost thou betray the Son of man with a kiss?  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>And they that were about him, seeing what would follow, said to him: Lord, shall we strike with the sword?  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>But Jesus answering, said: Suffer ye thus far. And when he had touched his ear, he healed him.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>And Jesus said to the chief priests, and magistrates of the temple, and the ancients, that were come unto him: Are ye come out, as it were against a thief, with swords and clubs?  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>When I was daily with you in the temple, you did not stretch forth your hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>And apprehending him, they led him to the high priest’s house. But Peter followed afar off.  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were sitting about it, Peter was in the midst of them.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>Whom when a certain servant maid had seen sitting at the light, and had earnestly beheld him, she said: This man also was with him.  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>But he denied him, saying: Woman, I know him not.  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>And after a little while, another seeing him, said: Thou also art one of them. But Peter said: O man, I am not.  <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>And after the space, as it were of one hour, another certain man affirmed, saying: Of a truth, this man was also with him; for he is also a Galilean.  <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>And Peter said: Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, as he was yet speaking, the cock crew.  <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>And the Lord turning looked on Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, as he had said: Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.  <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>And Peter going out, wept bitterly.  <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>And the men that held him, mocked him, and struck him.  <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#160;</span>And they blindfolded him, and smote his face. And they asked him, saying: Prophesy, who is it that struck thee?  <span class="verse" id="V65">65&#160;</span>And blaspheming, many other things they said against him.  <span class="verse" id="V66">66&#160;</span>And as soon as it was day, the ancients of the people, and the chief priests and scribes, cane together; and they brought him into their council, saying: If thou be the Christ, tell us.  <span class="verse" id="V67">67&#160;</span>And he saith to them: If I shall tell you, you will not believe me.  <span class="verse" id="V68">68&#160;</span>And if I shall also ask you, you will not answer me, nor let me go.  <span class="verse" id="V69">69&#160;</span>But hereafter the Son of man shall be sitting on the right hand of the power of God.  <span class="verse" id="V70">70&#160;</span>Then said they all: Art thou then the Son of God? Who said: You say that I am.  <span class="verse" id="V71">71&#160;</span>And they said: What need we any further testimony? for we ourselves have heard it from his own mouth. </div><ul class='tnav'>
