<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 23</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And the whole multitude of them rising up, led him to Pilate.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And they began to accuse him, saying: We have found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he is Christ the king.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And Pilate asked him, saying: Art thou the king of the Jews? But he answering, said: Thou sayest it.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And Pilate said to the chief priests and to the multitudes: I find no cause in this man.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But they were more earnest, saying: He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee to this place.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the man were of Galilee?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And when he understood that he was of Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him away to Herod, who was also himself at Jerusalem, in those days.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Herod, seeing Jesus, was very glad; for he was desirous of a long time to see him, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to see some sign wrought by him.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he questioned him in many words. But he answered him nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the chief priests and the scribes stood by, earnestly accusing him.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Herod with his army set him at nought, and mocked him, putting on him a white garment, and sent him back to Pilate.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Herod and Pilate were made friends, that same day; for before they were enemies one to another.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Pilate, calling together the chief priests, and the magistrates, and the people,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Said to them: You have presented unto me this man, as one that perverteth the people; and behold I, having examined him before you, find no cause in this man, in those things wherein you accuse him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>No, nor Herod neither. For I sent you to him, and behold, nothing worthy of death is done to him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I will chastise him therefore, and release him.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Now of necessity he was to release unto them one upon the feast day.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But the whole multitude together cried out, saying: Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Who, for a certain sedition made in the city, and for a murder, was cast into prison.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Pilate again spoke to them, desiring to release Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But they cried again, saying: Crucify him, crucify him.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And he said to them the third time: Why, what evil hath this man done? I find no cause of death in him. I will chastise him therefore, and let him go.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified; and their voices prevailed.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And he released unto them him who for murder and sedition, had been cast into prison, whom they had desired; but Jesus he delivered up to their will.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And as they led him away, they laid hold of one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country; and they laid the cross on him to carry after Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And there followed him a great multitude of people, and of women, who bewailed and lamented him.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But Jesus turning to them, said: Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not over me; but weep for yourselves, and for your children.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For behold, the days shall come, wherein they will say: Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that have not borne, and the paps that have not given suck.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Then shall they begin to say to the mountains: Fall upon us; and to the hills: Cover us.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For if in the green wood they do these things, what shall be done in the dry?  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And there were also two other malefactors led with him to be put to death.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And when they were come to the place which is called Calvary, they crucified him there; and the robbers, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And Jesus said: Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. But they, dividing his garments, cast lots.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And the people stood beholding, and the rulers with them derided him, saying: He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the elect of God.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And saying: If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And there was also a superscription written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And one of those robbers who were hanged, blasphemed him, saying: If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>But the other answering, rebuked him, saying: Neither dost thou fear God, seeing thou art condemned under the same condemnation?  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds; but this man hath done no evil.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And he said to Jesus: Lord, remember me when thou shalt come into thy kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And Jesus said to him: Amen I say to thee, this day thou shalt be with me in paradise.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And it was almost the sixth hour; and there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And Jesus crying out with a loud voice, said: Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit. And saying this, he gave up the ghost.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Now the centurion, seeing what was done, glorified God, saying: Indeed this was a just man.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>And all the multitude of them that were come together to that sight, and saw the things that were done, returned striking their breasts.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>And all his acquaintance, and the women that had followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>And behold there was a man named Joseph, who was a counsellor, a good and just man,  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>(The same had not consented to their counsel and doings;) of Arimathea, a city of Judea; who also himself looked for the kingdom of God.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>This man went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>And taking him down, he wrapped him in fine linen, and laid him in a sepulchre that was hewed in stone, wherein never yet any man had been laid.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>And it was the day of the Parasceve, and the sabbath drew on.  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>And the women that were come with him from Galilee, following after, saw the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>And returning, they prepared spices and ointments; and on the sabbath day they rested, according to the commandment. </div><ul class='tnav'>
