<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 24</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And they found the stone rolled back from the sepulchre.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And going in, they found not the body of the Lord Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And it came to pass, as they were astonished in their mind at this, behold, two men stood by them, in shining apparel.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And as they were afraid, and bowed down their countenance towards the ground, they said unto them: Why seek you the living with the dead?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>He is not here, but is risen. Remember how he spoke unto you, when he was in Galilee,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Saying: The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And they remembered his words.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And going back from the sepulchre, they told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And it was Mary Magdalen, and Joanna, and Mary of James, and the other women that were with them, who told these things to the apostles.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And these words seemed to them as idle tales; and they did not believe them.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But Peter rising up, ran to the sepulchre, and stooping down, he saw the linen cloths laid by themselves; and went away wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And behold, two of them went, the same day, to a town which was sixty furlongs from Jerusalem, named Emmaus.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And they talked together of all these things which had happened.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And it came to pass, that while they talked and reasoned with themselves, Jesus himself also drawing near, went with them.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But their eyes were held, that they should not know him.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he said to them: What are these discourses that you hold one with another as you walk, and are sad?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the one of them, whose name was Cleophas, answering, said to him: Art thou only a stranger to Jerusalem, and hast not known the things that have been done there in these days?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>To whom he said: What things? And they said: Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet, mighty in work and word before God and all the people;  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And how our chief priests and princes delivered him to be condemned to death, and crucified him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But we hoped, that it was he that should have redeemed Israel: and now besides all this, today is the third day since these things were done.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Yea and certain women also of our company affrighted us, who before it was light, were at the sepulchre,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And not finding his body, came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, who say that he is alive.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And some of our people went to the sepulchre, and found it so as the women had said, but him they found not.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then he said to them: O foolish, and slow of heart to believe in all things which the prophets have spoken.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and so to enter into his glory?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded to them in all the scriptures, the things that were concerning him.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And they drew night to the town, whither they were going: and he made as though he would go farther.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>But they constrained him; saying: Stay with us, because it is towards evening, and the day is now far spent. And he went in with them.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And it came to pass, whilst he was at table with them, he took bread, and blessed, and brake, and gave to them.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him: and he vanished out of their sight.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And they said one to the other: Was not our heart burning within us, whilst he spoke in this way, and opened to us the scriptures?  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And rising up, the same hour, they went back to Jerusalem: and they found the eleven gathered together, and those that were staying with them,  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Saying: The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And they told what things were done in the way; and how they knew him in the breaking of the bread.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Now whilst they were speaking these things, Jesus stood in the midst of them, and saith to them: Peace be to you; it is I, fear not.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>But they being troubled and frightened, supposed that they saw a spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And he said to them: Why are you troubled, and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>See my hands and feet, that it is I myself; handle, and see: for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as you see me to have.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And when he had said this, he shewed them his hands and feet.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>But while they yet believed not, and wondered for joy, he said: Have you any thing to eat?  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And they offered him a piece of a broiled fish, and a honeycomb.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And when he had eaten before them, taking the remains, he gave to them.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And he said to them: These are the words which I spoke to you, while I was yet with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Then he opened their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And he said to them: Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead, the third day:  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And that penance and remission of sins should be preached in his name, unto all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>And you are witnesses of these things.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>And I send the promise of my Father upon you: but stay you in the city till you be endued with power from on high.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>And he led them out as far as Bethania: and lifting up his hands, he blessed them.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>And it came to pass, whilst he blessed them, he departed from them, and was carried up to heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>And they adoring went back into Jerusalem with great joy.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>And they were always in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen. </div><ul class='tnav'>
