Was not Esau brother to Jacob, saith the Lord, and I have loved Jacob,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>But have hated Esau? and I have made his mountains a wilderness, and given his inheritance to the dragons of the desert.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But if Edom shall say: We are destroyed, but we will return and build up what hath been destroyed: thus saith the Lord of hosts: They shall build up, and I will throw down: and they shall be called the borders of wickedness, and the people with whom the Lord is angry for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And your eyes shall see, and you shall say: The Lord be magnified upon the border of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The son honoureth the father, and the servant his master: if then I be a father, where is my honour? and if I be a master, where is my fear? saith the Lord of hosts.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>To you, O priests, that despise my name, and have said: Wherein have we despised thy name? You offer polluted bread upon my altar, and you say: Wherein have we polluted thee? In that you say: The table of the Lord is contemptible.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>If you offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if you offer the lame and the sick, is it not evil? offer it to thy prince, if he will be pleased with it, or if he will regard thy face, saith the Lord of hosts.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And now beseech ye the face of God, that he may have mercy on you, (for by your hand hath this been done,) if by any means he will receive your faces, saith the Lord of hosts.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Who is there among you, that will shut the doors, and will kindle the fire on my altar gratis? I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord of hosts: and I will not receive a gift of your hand.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For from the rising of the sun even to the going down, my name is great among the Gentiles, and in every place there is sacrifice, and there is offered to my name a clean oblation: for my name is great among the Gentiles, saith the Lord of hosts.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And you have profaned it in that you say: The table of the Lord is defiled: and that which is laid thereupon is contemptible with the fire that devoureth it.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And you have said: Behold of our labour, and you puffed it away, saith the Lord of hosts, and you brought in of rapine the lame, and the sick, and brought in an offering: shall I accept it at your hands, saith the Lord?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Cursed is the deceitful man that hath in his flock a male, and making a vow offereth in sacrifice that which is feeble to the Lord: for I am a great King, saith the Lord of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the Gentiles. </div><ul class='tnav'>
