And presently the Lord, whom you seek, and the angel of the testament, whom you desire, shall come to his temple. Behold he cometh, saith the Lord of hosts.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And who shall be able to think of the day of his coming? and who shall stand to see him? for he is like a refining fire, and like the fuller’s herb:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And he shall sit refining and cleansing the silver, and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and shall refine them as gold, and as silver, and they shall offer sacrifices to the Lord in justice.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the sacrifice of Juda and of Jerusalem shall please the Lord, as in the days of old, and in the ancient years.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And I will come to you in judgment, and will be a speedy witness against sorcerers, and adulterers, and false swearers, and them that oppress the hireling in his wages; the widows, and the fatherless: and oppress the stranger, and have not feared me, saith the Lord of hosts.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For I am the Lord, and I change not: and you the sons of Jacob are not consumed.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For from the days of your fathers you have departed from my ordinances, and have not kept them: Return to me, and I will return to you, saith the Lord of hosts. And you have said: Wherein shall we return?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Shall a man afflict God? for you afflict me. And you have said: Wherein do we afflict thee? in tithes and in firstfruits.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And you are cursed with want, and you afflict me, even the whole nation of you.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Bring all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in my house, and try me in this, saith the Lord: if I open not unto you the flood-gates of heaven, and pour you out a blessing even to abundance.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And I will rebuke for your sakes the devourer, and he shall not spoil the fruit of your land: neither shall the vine in the field be barren, saith the Lord of hosts.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And all nations shall call you blessed: for you shall be a delightful land, saith the Lord of hosts.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Your words have been unsufferable to me, saith the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And you have said: What have we spoken against thee? You have said: He laboureth in vain that serveth God, and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinances, and that we have walked sorrowful before the Lord of hosts?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Wherefore now we call the proud people happy, for they that work wickedness are built up, and they have tempted God and are preserved.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then they that feared the Lord spoke every one with his neighbour: and the Lord gave ear, and heard it: and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that fear the Lord, and think on his name.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And they shall be my special possession, saith the Lord of hosts, in the day that I do judgment: and I will spare them, as a man spareth his son that serveth him.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And you shall return, and shall see the difference between the just and the wicked: and between him that serveth God, and him that serveth him not. </div><ul class='tnav'>
