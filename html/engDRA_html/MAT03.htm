For I tell you that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that doth not yield good fruit, shall be cut down, and cast into the fire.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I indeed baptize you in the water unto penance, but he that shall come after me, is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; he shall baptize you in the Holy Ghost and fire.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his floor and gather his wheat into the barn; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan, unto John, to be baptized by him.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But John stayed him, saying: I ought to be baptized by thee, and comest thou to me?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Jesus answering, said to him: Suffer it to be so now. For so it becometh us to fulfill all justice. Then he suffered him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Jesus being baptized, forthwith came out of the water: and lo, the heavens were opened to him: and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And behold a voice from heaven, saying: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. </div><ul class='tnav'>
