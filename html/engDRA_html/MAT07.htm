For this is the law and the prophets.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Enter ye in at the narrow gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there are who go in thereat.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>How narrow is the gate, and strait is the way that leadeth to life: and few there are that find it!  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Beware of false prophets, who come to you in the clothing of sheep, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>By their fruits you shall know them. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, and the evil tree bringeth forth evil fruit.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can an evil tree bring forth good fruit.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, shall be cut down, and shall be cast into the fire.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Wherefore by their fruits you shall know them.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Not every one that saith to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven: but he that doth the will of my Father who is in heaven, he shall enter into the kingdom of heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Many will say to me in that day: Lord, Lord, have not we prophesied in thy name, and cast out devils in thy name, and done many miracles in thy name?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, you that work iniquity.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Every one therefore that heareth these my words, and doth them, shall be likened to a wise man that built his house upon a rock,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and they beat upon that house, and it fell not, for it was founded on a rock.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And every one that heareth these my words, and doth them not, shall be like a foolish man that built his house upon the sand,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and they beat upon that house, and it fell, and great was the fall thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And it came to pass when Jesus had fully ended these words, the people were in admiration at his doctrine.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For he was teaching them as one having power, and not as the scribes and Pharisees. </div><ul class='tnav'>
