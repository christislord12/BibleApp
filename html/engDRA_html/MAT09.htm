<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 9</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And entering into a boat, he passed over the water and came into his own city.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And behold they brought to him one sick of the palsy lying in a bed. And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the man sick of the palsy: Be of good heart, son, thy sins are forgiven thee.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And behold some of the scribes said within themselves: He blasphemeth.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And Jesus seeing their thoughts, said: Why do you think evil in your hearts?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee: or to say, Arise, and walk?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But that you may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then said he to the man sick of palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go into thy house.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And he arose, and went into his house.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the multitude seeing it, feared, and glorified God that gave such power to men.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And when Jesus passed on from hence, he saw a man sitting in the custom house, named Matthew; and he saith to him: Follow me. And he rose up and followed him.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And it came to pass as he was sitting at meat in the house, behold many publicans and sinners came, and sat down with Jesus and his disciples.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the Pharisees seeing it, said to his disciples: Why doth your master eat with publicans and sinners?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But Jesus hearing it, said: They that are in health need not a physician, but they that are ill.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Go then and learn what this meaneth, I will have mercy and not sacrifice. For I am not come to call the just, but sinners.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then came to him the disciples of John, saying: Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but thy disciples do not fast?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Jesus said to them: Can the children of the bridegroom mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then they shall fast.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And nobody putteth a piece of raw cloth unto an old garment. For it taketh away the fullness thereof from the garment, and there is made a greater rent.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Neither do they put new wine into old bottles. Otherwise the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish. But new wine they put into new bottles: and both are preserved.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he was speaking these things unto them, behold a certain ruler came up, and adored him, saying: Lord, my daughter is even now dead; but come, lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Jesus rising up followed him, with his disciples.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And behold a woman who was troubled with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For she said within herself: If I shall touch only his garment, I shall be healed.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But Jesus turning and seeing her, said: Be of good heart, daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And when Jesus was come into the house of the ruler, and saw the minstrels and the multitude making a rout,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>He said: Give place, for the girl is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And when the multitude was put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand. And the maid arose.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the fame hereof went abroad into all that country.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And as Jesus passed from thence, there followed him two blind men crying out and saying, Have mercy on us, O Son of David.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And when he was come to the house, the blind men came to him. And Jesus saith to them, Do you believe, that I can do this unto you? They say to him, Yea, Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Then he touched their eyes, saying, According to your faith, be it done unto you.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And their eyes were opened, and Jesus strictly charged them, saying, See that no man know this.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>But they going out, spread his fame abroad in all that country.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And when they were gone out, behold they brought him a dumb man, possessed with a devil.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And after the devil was cast out, the dumb man spoke, and the multitudes wondered, saying, Never was the like seen in Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But the Pharisees said, By the prince of devils he casteth out devils.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And Jesus went about all the cities, and towns, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease, and every infirmity.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And seeing the multitudes, he had compassion on them: because they were distressed, and lying like sheep that have no shepherd.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Then he saith to his disciples, The harvest indeed is great, but the labourers are few.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he send forth labourers into his harvest. </div><ul class='tnav'>
