Behold they that are clothed in soft garments, are in the houses of kings.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But what went you out to see? a prophet? yea I tell you, and more than a prophet.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For this is he of whom it is written: Behold I send my angel before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Amen I say to you, there hath not risen among them that are born of women a greater than John the Baptist: yet he that is the lesser in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent bear it away.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And if you will receive it, he is Elias that is to come.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But whereunto shall I esteem this generation to be like? It is like to children sitting in the market place.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Who crying to their companions say: We have piped to you, and you have not danced: we have lamented, and you have not mourned.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For John came neither eating nor drinking; and they say: He hath a devil.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say: Behold a man that is a glutton and a wine drinker, a friend of publicans and sinners. And wisdom is justified by her children.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein were done the most of his miracles, for that they had not done penance.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Woe to thee, Corozain, woe to thee, Bethsaida: for if in Tyre and Sidon had been wrought the miracles that have been wrought in you, they had long ago done penance in sackcloth and ashes.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment, than for you.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And thou Capharnaum, shalt thou be exalted up to heaven? thou shalt go down even unto hell. For if in Sodom had been wrought the miracles that have been wrought in thee, perhaps it had remained unto this day.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>At that time Jesus answered and said: I confess to thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to the little ones.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Yea, Father; for so hath it seemed good in thy sight.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>All things are delivered to me by my Father. And no one knoweth the Son, but the Father: neither doth any one know the Father, but the Son, and he to whom it shall please the Son to reveal him.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Come to me, all you that labour, and are burdened, and I will refresh you.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Take up my yoke upon you, and learn of me, because I am meek, and humble of heart: and you shall find rest to your souls.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For my yoke is sweet and my burden light. </div><ul class='tnav'>
