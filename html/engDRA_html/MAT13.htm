And the servants said to him: Wilt thou that we go and gather it up?  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And he said: No, lest perhaps gathering up the cockle, you root up the wheat also together with it.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Suffer both to grow until the harvest, and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers: Gather up first the cockle, and bind it into bundles to burn, but the wheat gather ye into my barn.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Another parable he proposed unto them, saying: The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Which is the least indeed of all seeds; but when it is grown up, it is greater than all herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come, and dwell in the branches thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Another parable he spoke to them: The kingdom of heaven is like to leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, until the whole was leavened.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>All these things Jesus spoke in parables to the multitudes: and without parables he did not speak to them.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Then having sent away the multitudes, he came into the house, and his disciples came to him, saying: Expound to us the parable of the cockle of the field.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Who made answer and said to them: He that soweth the good seed, is the Son of man.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And the field, is the world. And the good seed are the children of the kingdom. And the cockle, are the children of the wicked one.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And the enemy that sowed them, is the devil. But the harvest is the end of the world. And the reapers are the angels.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Even as cockle therefore is gathered up, and burnt with fire: so shall it be at the end of the world.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>The Son of man shall send his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all scandals, and them that work iniquity.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Then shall the just shine as the sun, in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>The kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in a field. Which a man having found, hid it, and for joy thereof goeth, and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Again the kingdom of heaven is like to a merchant seeking good pearls.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Who when he had found one pearl of great price, went his way, and sold all that he had, and bought it.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Again the kingdom of heaven is like to a net cast into the sea, and gathering together of all kind of fishes.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Which, when it was filled, they drew out, and sitting by the shore, they chose out the good into vessels, but the bad they cast forth.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>So shall it be at the end of the world. The angels shall go out, and shall separate the wicked from among the just.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Have ye understood all these things? They say to him: Yes.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>He said unto them: Therefore every scribe instructed in the kingdom of heaven, is like to a man that is a householder, who bringeth forth out of his treasure new things and old.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>And it came to pass: when Jesus had finished these parables, he passed from thence.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>And coming into his own country, he taught them in their synagogues, so that they wondered and said: How came this man by this wisdom and miracles?  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>Is not this the carpenter’s son? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brethren James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Jude:  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence therefore hath he all these things?  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>And they were scandalized in his regard. But Jesus said to them: A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>And he wrought not many miracles there, because of their unbelief. </div><ul class='tnav'>
