And they took up what remained, twelve full baskets of fragments.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the number of them that did eat, was five thousand men, besides women and children.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And forthwith Jesus obliged his disciples to go up into the boat, and to go before him over the water, till he dismissed the people.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And having dismissed the multitude, he went into a mountain alone to pray. And when it was evening, he was there alone.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But the boat in the midst of the sea was tossed with the waves: for the wind was contrary.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And in the fourth watch of the night, he came to them walking upon the sea.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And they seeing him walk upon the sea, were troubled, saying: It is an apparition. And they cried out for fear.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying: Be of good heart: it is I, fear ye not.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Peter making answer, said: Lord, if it be thou, bid me come to thee upon the waters.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And he said: Come. And Peter going down out of the boat, walked upon the water to come to Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But seeing the wind strong, he was afraid: and when he began to sink, he cried out, saying: Lord, save me.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And immediately Jesus stretching forth his hand took hold of him, and said to him: O thou of little faith, why didst thou doubt?  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And when they were come up into the boat, the wind ceased.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And they that were in the boat came and adored him, saying: Indeed thou art the Son of God.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And having passed the water, they came into the country of Genesar.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent into all that country, and brought to him all that were diseased.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And they besought him that they might touch but the hem of his garment. And as many as touched, were made whole. </div><ul class='tnav'>
