<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 17</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And after six days Jesus taketh unto him Peter and James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart:  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And he was transfigured before them. And his face did shine as the sun: and his garments became white as snow.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And behold there appeared to them Moses and Elias talking with him.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And Peter answering, said to Jesus: Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And as he was yet speaking, behold a bright cloud overshadowed them. And lo, a voice out of the cloud, saying: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased: hear ye him.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the disciples hearing, fell upon their face, and were very much afraid.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And Jesus came and touched them: and said to them, Arise, and fear not.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And they lifting up their eyes saw no one but only Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying: Tell the vision to no man, till the Son of man be risen from the dead.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And his disciples asked him, saying: Why then do the scribes say that Elias must come first?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But he answering, said to them: Elias indeed shall come, and restore all things.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But I say to you, that Elias is already come, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they had a mind. So also the Son of man shall suffer from them.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then the disciples understood, that he had spoken to them of John the Baptist.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And when he was come to the multitude, there came to him a man falling down on his knees before him, saying: Lord, have pity on my son, for he is a lunatic, and suffereth much: for he falleth often into the fire, and often into the water.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then Jesus answered and said: O unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Jesus rebuked him, and the devil went out of him, and the child was cured from that hour.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then came the disciples to Jesus secretly, and said: Why could not we cast him out?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Jesus said to them: Because of your unbelief. For, amen I say to you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain, Remove from hence hither, and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible to you.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But this kind is not cast out but by prayer and fasting.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And when they abode together in Galilee, Jesus said to them: The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall rise again. And they were troubled exceedingly.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And when they were come to Capharnaum, they that received the didrachmas, came to Peter and said to him: Doth not your master pay the didrachmas?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>He said: Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying: What is thy opinion, Simon? The kings of the earth, of whom do they receive tribute or custom? of their own children, or of strangers?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And he said: Of strangers. Jesus said to him: Then the children are free.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But that we may not scandalize them, go to the sea, and cast in a hook: and that fish which shall first come up, take: and when thou hast opened its mouth, thou shalt find a stater: take that, and give it to them for me and thee. </div><ul class='tnav'>
