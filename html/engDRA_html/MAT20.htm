<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 20</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>The kingdom of heaven is like to an householder, who went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And having agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And going about the third hour, he saw others standing in the market place idle.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And he said to them: Go you also into my vineyard, and I will give you what shall be just.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And they went their way. And again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did in like manner.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing, and he saith to them: Why stand you here all the day idle?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>They say to him: Because no man hath hired us. He saith to them: Go you also into my vineyard.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And when evening was come, the lord of the vineyard saith to his steward: Call the labourers and pay them their hire, beginning from the last even to the first.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>When therefore they were come, that came about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But when the first also came, they thought that they should receive more: and they also received every man a penny.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And receiving it they murmured against the master of the house,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Saying: These last have worked but one hour, and thou hast made them equal to us, that have borne the burden of the day and the heats.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But he answering said to one of them: Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst thou not agree with me for a penny?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Take what is thine, and go thy way: I will also give to this last even as to thee.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Or, is it not lawful for me to do what I will? is thy eye evil, because I am good?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So shall the last be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few chosen.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Jesus going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples apart, and said to them:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Behold we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be betrayed to the chief priests and the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to be mocked, and scourged, and crucified, and the third day he shall rise again.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee with her sons, adoring and asking something of him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Who said to her: What wilt thou? She saith to him: Say that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left, in thy kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Jesus answering, said: You know not what you ask. Can you drink the chalice that I shall drink? They say to him: We can.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>He saith to them: My chalice indeed you shall drink; but to sit on my right or left hand, is not mine to give to you, but to them for whom it is prepared by my Father.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the ten hearing it, were moved with indignation against the two brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But Jesus called them to him, and said: You know that the princes of the Gentiles lord it over them; and they that are the greater, exercise power upon them.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>It shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be the greater among you, let him be your minister:  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And he that will be first among you, shall be your servant.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Even as the Son of man is not come to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a redemption for many.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And when they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And behold two blind men sitting by the way side, heard that Jesus passed by, and they cried out, saying: O Lord, thou son of David, have mercy on us.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And the multitude rebuked them that they should hold their peace. But they cried out the more, saying: O Lord, thou son of David, have mercy on us.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And Jesus stood, and called them, and said: What will ye that I do to you?  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>They say to him: Lord, that our eyes be opened.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And Jesus having compassion on them, touched their eyes. And immediately they saw, and followed him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
