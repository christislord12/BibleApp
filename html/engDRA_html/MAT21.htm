And Jesus said to them: Yea, have you never read: Out of the mouth of infants and of sucklings thou hast perfected praise?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And leaving them, he went out of the city into Bethania, and remained there.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And in the morning, returning into the city, he was hungry.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And seeing a certain fig tree by the way side, he came to it, and found nothing on it but leaves only, and he saith to it: May no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And immediately the fig tree withered away.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the disciples seeing it wondered, saying: How is it presently withered away?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Jesus answering, said to them: Amen, I say to you, if you shall have faith, and stagger not, not only this of the fig tree shall you do, but also if you shall say to this mountain, Take up and cast thyself into the sea, it shall be done.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And in all things whatsoever you shall ask in prayer, believing, you shall receive.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And when he was come into the temple, there came to him, as he was teaching, the chief priests and ancients of the people, saying: By what authority dost thou these things? and who hath given thee this authority?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Jesus answering, said to them: I also will ask you one word, which if you shall tell me, I will also tell you by what authority I do these things.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven or from men? But they thought within themselves, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>If we shall say, from heaven, he will say to us: Why then did you not believe him? But if we shall say, from men, we are afraid of the multitude: for all held John as a prophet.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And answering Jesus, they said: We know not. He also said to them: Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But what think you? A certain man had two sons; and coming to the first, he said: Son, go work today in my vineyard.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And he answering, said: I will not. But afterwards, being moved with repentance, he went.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And coming to the other, he said in like manner. And he answering, said: I go, Sir; and he went not.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Which of the two did the father’s will? They say to him: The first. Jesus saith to them: Amen I say to you, that the publicans and the harlots shall go into the kingdom of God before you.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>For John came to you in the way of justice, and you did not believe him. But the publicans and the harlots believed him: but you, seeing it, did not even afterwards repent, that you might believe him.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Hear ye another parable. There was a man an householder, who planted a vineyard, and made a hedge round about it, and dug in it a press, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen; and went into a strange country.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And when the time of the fruits drew nigh, he sent his servants to the husbandmen that they might receive the fruits thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And the husbandmen laying hands on his servants, beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Again he sent other servants more than the former; and they did to them in like manner.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And last of all he sent to them his son, saying: They will reverence my son.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>But the husbandmen seeing the son, said among themselves: This is the heir: come, let us kill him, and we shall have his inheritance.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And taking him, they cast him forth out of the vineyard, and killed him.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>When therefore the lord of the vineyard shall come, what will he do to those husbandmen?  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>They say to him: He will bring those evil men to an evil end; and will let out his vineyard to other husbandmen, that shall render him the fruit in due season.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Jesus saith to them: Have you never read in the Scriptures: The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner? By the Lord this has been done; and it is wonderful in our eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Therefore I say to you, that the kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and shall be given to a nation yielding the fruits thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And whosoever shall fall on this stone, shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it shall grind him to powder.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they knew that he spoke of them.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And seeking to lay hands on him, they feared the multitudes: because they held him as a prophet. </div><ul class='tnav'>
