<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 22</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And Jesus answering, spoke again in parables to them, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The kingdom of heaven is likened to a king, who made a marriage for his son.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And he sent his servants, to call them that were invited to the marriage; and they would not come.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Again he sent other servants, saying: Tell them that were invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my beeves and fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come ye to the marriage.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But they neglected, and went their own ways, one to his farm, and another to his merchandise.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the rest laid hands on his servants, and having treated them contumeliously, put them to death.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But when the king had heard of it, he was angry, and sending his armies, he destroyed those murderers, and burnt their city.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then he saith to his servants: The marriage indeed is ready; but they that were invited were not worthy.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Go ye therefore into the highways; and as many as you shall find, call to the marriage.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And his servants going forth into the ways, gathered together all that they found, both bad and good: and the marriage was filled with guests.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the king went in to see the guests: and he saw there a man who had not on a wedding garment.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he saith to him: Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? But he was silent.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then the king said to the waiters: Bind his hands and feet, and cast him into the exterior darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For many are called, but few are chosen.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then the Pharisees going, consulted among themselves how to insnare him in his speech.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And they sent to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying: Master, we know that thou art a true speaker, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou dost not regard the person of men.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Tell us therefore what dost thou think, is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But Jesus knowing their wickedness, said: Why do you tempt me, ye hypocrites?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Shew me the coin of the tribute. And they offered him a penny.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Jesus saith to them: Whose image and inscription is this?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>They say to him: Caesar’s. Then he saith to them: Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s; and to God, the things that are God’s.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And hearing this they wondered, and leaving him, went their ways.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>That day there came to him the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection; and asked him,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Saying: Master, Moses said: If a man die having no son, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up issue to his brother.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first having married a wife, died; and not having issue, left his wife to his brother.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>In like manner the second, and the third, and so on to the seventh.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And last of all the woman died also.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>At the resurrection therefore whose wife of the seven shall she be? for they all had her.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Jesus answering, said to them: You err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For in the resurrection they shall neither marry nor be married; but shall be as the angels of God in heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken by God, saying to you:  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And the multitudes hearing it, were in admiration at his doctrine.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But the Pharisees hearing that he had silenced the Sadducees, came together:  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And one of them, a doctor of the law, asking him, tempting him:  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Master, which is the greatest commandment in the law?  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Jesus said to him: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, and with thy whole soul, and with thy whole mind.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>This is the greatest and the first commandment.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And the second is like to this: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>On these two commandments dependeth the whole law and the prophets.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And the Pharisees being gathered together, Jesus asked them,  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Saying: What think you of Christ? whose son is he? They say to him: David’s.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>He saith to them: How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>The Lord said to my Lord, Sit on my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy footstool?  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And no man was able to answer him a word; neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions. </div><ul class='tnav'>
