There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And when the Son of man shall come in his majesty, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit upon the seat of his majesty.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And all nations shall be gathered together before him, and he shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats:  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Then shall the king say to them that shall be on his right hand: Come, ye blessed of my Father, possess you the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>For I was hungry, and you gave me to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me to drink; I was a stranger, and you took me in:  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Naked, and you covered me: sick, and you visited me: I was in prison, and you came to me.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Then shall the just answer him, saying: Lord, when did we see thee hungry, and fed thee; thirsty, and gave thee drink?  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And when did we see thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and covered thee?  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Or when did we see thee sick or in prison, and came to thee?  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And the king answering, shall say to them: Amen I say to you, as long as you did it to one of these my least brethren, you did it to me.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Then he shall say to them also that shall be on his left hand: Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>For I was hungry, and you gave me not to eat: I was thirsty, and you gave me not to drink.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>I was a stranger, and you took me not in: naked, and you covered me not: sick and in prison, and you did not visit me.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Then they also shall answer him, saying: Lord, when did we see thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to thee?  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Then he shall answer them, saying: Amen I say to you, as long as you did it not to one of these least, neither did you do it to me.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And these shall go into everlasting punishment: but the just, into life everlasting. </div><ul class='tnav'>
