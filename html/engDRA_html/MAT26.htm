<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 26</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended all these words, he said to his disciples:  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>You know that after two days shall be the pasch, and the son of man shall be delivered up to be crucified:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then were gathered together the chief priests and ancients of the people into the court of the high priest, who was called Caiphas:  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And they consulted together, that by subtilty they might apprehend Jesus, and put him to death.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But they said: Not on the festival day, lest perhaps there should be a tumult among the people.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And when Jesus was in Bethania, in the house of Simon the leper,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>There came to him a woman having an alabaster box of precious ointment, and poured it on his head as he was at table.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the disciples seeing it, had indignation, saying: To what purpose is this waste?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For this might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Jesus knowing it, said to them: Why do you trouble this woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For the poor you have always with you: but me you have not always.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For she in pouring this ointment upon my body, hath done it for my burial.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Amen I say to you, wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which she hath done, shall be told for a memory of her.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then went one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, to the chief priests,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And said to them: What will you give me, and I will deliver him unto you? But they appointed him thirty pieces of silver.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And from thenceforth he sought opportunity to betray him.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And on the first day of the Azymes, the disciples came to Jesus, saying: Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the pasch?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But Jesus said: Go ye into the city to a certain man, and say to him: the master saith, My time is near at hand, with thee I make the pasch with my disciples.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the disciples did as Jesus appointed to them, and they prepared the pasch.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But when it was evening, he sat down with his twelve disciples.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And whilst they were eating, he said: Amen I say to you, that one of you is about to betray me.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And they being very much troubled, began every one to say: Is it I, Lord?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But he answering, said: He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, he shall betray me.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed: it were better for him, if that man had not been born.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Judas that betrayed him, answering, said: Is it I, Rabbi? He saith to him: Thou hast said it.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And whilst they were at supper, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke: and gave to his disciples, and said: Take ye, and eat. This is my body.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And taking the chalice, he gave thanks, and gave to them, saying: Drink ye all of this.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For this is my blood of the new testament, which shall be shed for many unto remission of sins.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And I say to you, I will not drink from henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I shall drink it with you new in the kingdom of my Father.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And a hymn being said, they went out unto mount Olivet.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then Jesus said to them: All you shall be scandalized in me this night. For it is written: I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be dispersed.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But after I shall be risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And Peter answering, said to him: Although all shall be scandalized in thee, I will never be scandalized.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Jesus said to him: Amen I say to thee, that in this night before the cock crow, thou wilt deny me thrice.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Peter saith to him: Yea, though I should die with thee, I will not deny thee. And in like manner said all the disciples.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Then Jesus came with them into a country place which is called Gethsemani; and he said to his disciples: Sit you here, till I go yonder and pray.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to grow sorrowful and to be sad.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Then he saith to them: My soul is sorrowful even unto death: stay you here, and watch with me.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And going a little further, he fell upon his face, praying, and saying: My Father, if it be possible, let this chalice pass from me. Nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And he cometh to his disciples, and findeth them asleep, and he saith to Peter: What? Could you not watch one hour with me?  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Watch ye, and pray that ye enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh weak.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Again the second time, he went and prayed, saying: My Father, if this chalice may not pass away, but I must drink it, thy will be done.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And he cometh again and findeth them sleeping: for their eyes were heavy.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And leaving them, he went again: and he prayed the third time, saying the selfsame word.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Then he cometh to his disciples, and saith to them: Sleep ye now and take your rest; behold the hour is at hand, and the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Rise, let us go: behold he is at hand that will betray me.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>As he yet spoke, behold Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the ancients of the people.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>And he that betrayed him, gave them a sign, saying: Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he, hold him fast.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>And forthwith coming to Jesus, he said: Hail, Rabbi. And he kissed him.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>And Jesus said to him: Friend, whereto art thou come? Then they came up, and laid hands on Jesus, and held him.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>And behold one of them that were with Jesus, stretching forth his hand, drew out his sword: and striking the servant of the high priest, cut off his ear.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>Then Jesus saith to him: Put up again thy sword into its place: for all that take the sword shall perish with the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>Thinkest thou that I cannot ask my Father, and he will give me presently more than twelve legions of angels?  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>How then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that so it must be done?  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>In that same hour Jesus said to the multitudes: You are come out as it were to a robber with swords and clubs to apprehend me. I sat daily with you, teaching in the temple, and you laid not hands on me.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>Now all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then the disciples all leaving him, fled.  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>But they holding Jesus led him to Caiphas the high priest, where the scribes and the ancients were assembled.  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>And Peter followed him afar off, even to the court of the high priest. And going in, he sat with the servants, that he might see the end.  <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>And the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness against Jesus, that they might put him to death:  <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>And they found not, whereas many false witnesses had come in. And last of all there came two false witnesses:  <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>And they said: This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and after three days to rebuild it.  <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>And the high priest rising up, said to him: Answerest thou nothing to the things which these witness against thee?  <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest said to him: I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us if thou be the Christ the Son of God.  <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#160;</span>Jesus saith to him: Thou hast said it. Nevertheless I say to you, hereafter you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of the power of God, and coming in the clouds of heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V65">65&#160;</span>Then the high priests rent his garments, saying: He hath blasphemed; what further need have we of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard the blasphemy:  <span class="verse" id="V66">66&#160;</span>What think you? But they answering, said: He is guilty of death.  <span class="verse" id="V67">67&#160;</span>Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him: and others struck his face with the palms of their hands,  <span class="verse" id="V68">68&#160;</span>Saying: Prophesy unto us, O Christ, who is he that struck thee?  <span class="verse" id="V69">69&#160;</span>But Peter sat without in the court: and there came to him a servant maid, saying: Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilean.  <span class="verse" id="V70">70&#160;</span>But he denied before them all, saying: I know not what thou sayest.  <span class="verse" id="V71">71&#160;</span>And as he went out of the gate, another maid saw him, and she saith to them that were there: This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.  <span class="verse" id="V72">72&#160;</span>And again he denied with an oath, I know not the man.  <span class="verse" id="V73">73&#160;</span>And after a little while they came that stood by, and said to Peter: Surely thou also art one of them; for even thy speech doth discover thee.  <span class="verse" id="V74">74&#160;</span>Then he began to curse and to swear that he knew not the man. And immediately the cock crew.  <span class="verse" id="V75">75&#160;</span>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus which he had said: Before the cock crow, thou wilt deny me thrice. And going forth, he wept bitterly. </div><ul class='tnav'>
