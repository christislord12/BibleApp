<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 27</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And when morning was come, all the chief priests and ancients of the people took counsel against Jesus, that they might put him to death.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And they brought him bound, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then Judas, who betrayed him, seeing that he was condemned, repenting himself, brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and ancients,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Saying: I have sinned in betraying innocent blood. But they said: What is that to us? look thou to it.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And casting down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed: and went and hanged himself with an halter.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But the chief priests having taken the pieces of silver, said: It is not lawful to put them into the corbona, because it is the price of blood.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And after they had consulted together, they bought with them the potter’s field, to be a burying place for strangers.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For this cause the field was called Haceldama, that is, The field of blood, even to this day.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremias the prophet, saying: And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was prized, whom they prized of the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And they gave them unto the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed to me.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, saying: Art thou the king of the Jews? Jesus saith to him: Thou sayest it.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And when he was accused by the chief priests and ancients, he answered nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then Pilate saith to him: Dost not thou hear how great testimonies they allege against thee?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he answered him to never a word; so that the governor wondered exceedingly.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Now upon the solemn day the governor was accustomed to release to the people one prisoner, whom they would.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And he had then a notorious prisoner, that was called Barabbas.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>They therefore being gathered together, Pilate said: Whom will you that I release to you, Barabbas, or Jesus that is called Christ?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And as he was sitting in the place of judgment, his wife sent to him, saying: Have thou nothing to do with that just man; for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But the chief priests and ancients persuaded the people, that they should ask Barabbas, and make Jesus away.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the governor answering, said to them: Whether will you of the two to be released unto you? But they said, Barabbas.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Pilate saith to them: What shall I do then with Jesus that is called Christ? They say all: Let him be crucified.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The governor said to them: Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying: Let him be crucified.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Pilate seeing that he prevailed nothing, but that rather a tumult was made; taking water washed his hands before the people, saying: I am innocent of the blood of this just man; look you to it.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And the whole people answering, said: His blood be upon us and our children.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then he released to them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him unto them to be crucified.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then the soldiers of the governor taking Jesus into the hall, gathered together unto him the whole band;  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And stripping him, they put a scarlet cloak about him.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And platting a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand. And bowing the knee before him, they mocked him, saying: Hail, king of the Jews.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And spitting upon him, they took the reed, and struck his head.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And after they had mocked him, they took off the cloak from him, and put on him his own garments, and led him away to crucify him.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And going out, they found a man of Cyrene, named Simon: him they forced to take up his cross.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And they came to the place that is called Golgotha, which is the place of Calvary.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall. And when he had tasted, he would not drink.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And after they had crucified him, they divided his garments, casting lots; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: They divided my garments among them; and upon my vesture they cast lots.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And they sat and watched him.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And they put over his head his cause written: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Then were crucified with him two thieves: one on the right hand, and one on the left.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And they that passed by, blasphemed him, wagging their heads,  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And saying: Vah, thou that destroyest the temple of God, and in three days dost rebuild it: save thy own self: if thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>In like manner also the chief priests, with the scribes and ancients, mocking, said:  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the king of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>He trusted in God; let him now deliver him if he will have him; for he said: I am the Son of God.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And the selfsame thing the thieves also, that were crucified with him, reproached him with.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over the whole earth, until the ninth hour.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying: Eli, Eli, lamma sabacthani? that is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And some that stood there and heard, said: This man calleth Elias.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>And immediately one of them running took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar; and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>And the others said: Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to deliver him.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>And Jesus again crying with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>And behold the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top even to the bottom, and the earth quaked, and the rocks were rent.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>And the graves were opened: and many bodies of the saints that had slept arose,  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>And coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, came into the holy city, and appeared to many.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>Now the centurion and they that were with him watching Jesus, having seen the earthquake, and the things that were done, were sore afraid, saying: Indeed this was the Son of God.  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>And there were there many women afar off, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>Among whom was Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>And when it was evening, there came a certain rich man of Arimathea, named Joseph, who also himself was a disciple of Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>He went to Pilate, and asked the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded that the body should be delivered.  <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>And Joseph taking the body, wrapped it up in a clean linen cloth.  <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>And laid it in his own new monument, which he had hewed out in a rock. And he rolled a great stone to the door of the monument, and went his way.  <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>And there was there Mary Magdalen, and the other Mary sitting over against the sepulchre.  <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>And the next day, which followed the day of preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees came together to Pilate,  <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>Saying: Sir, we have remembered, that that seducer said, while he was yet alive: After three days I will rise again.  <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#160;</span>Command therefore the sepulchre to be guarded until the third day: lest perhaps his disciples come and steal him away, and say to the people: He is risen from the dead; and the last error shall be worse than the first.  <span class="verse" id="V65">65&#160;</span>Pilate saith to them: You have a guard; go, guard it as you know.  <span class="verse" id="V66">66&#160;</span>And they departing, made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting guards. </div><ul class='tnav'>
