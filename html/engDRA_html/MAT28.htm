<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 28</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And in the end of the sabbath, when it began to dawn towards the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalen and the other Mary, to see the sepulchre.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And behold there was a great earthquake. For an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and coming, rolled back the stone, and sat upon it.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And his countenance was as lightning, and his raiment as snow.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And for fear of him, the guards were struck with terror, and became as dead men.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the angel answering, said to the women: Fear not you; for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>He is not here, for he is risen, as he said. Come, and see the place where the Lord was laid.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And going quickly, tell ye his disciples that he is risen: and behold he will go before you into Galilee; there you shall see him. Lo, I have foretold it to you.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And they went out quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy, running to tell his disciples.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And behold Jesus met them, saying: All hail. But they came up and took hold of his feet, and adored him.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then Jesus said to them: Fear not. Go, tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, there they shall see me.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Who when they were departed, behold some of the guards came into the city, and told the chief priests all things that had been done.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And they being assembled together with the ancients, taking counsel, gave a great sum of money to the soldiers,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Saying: Say you, His disciples came by night, and stole him away when we were asleep.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And if the governor shall hear this, we will persuade him, and secure you.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So they taking the money, did as they were taught: and this word was spread abroad among the Jews even unto this day.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the eleven disciples went into Galilee, unto the mountain where Jesus had appointed them.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And seeing them they adored: but some doubted.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Jesus coming, spoke to them, saying: All power is given to me in heaven and in earth.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Going therefore, teach ye all nations; baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and behold I am with you all days, even to the consummation of the world. </div><ul class='tnav'>
