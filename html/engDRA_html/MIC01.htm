What is the wickedness of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Juda? are they not Jerusalem?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And I will make Samaria as a heap of stones in the field when a vineyard is planted: and I will bring down the stones thereof into the valley, and will lay her foundations bare.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And all her graven things shall be cut in pieces, and all her wages shall be burnt with fire, and I will bring to destruction all her idols: for they were gathered together of the hire of a harlot, and unto the hire of a harlot they shall return.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Therefore will I lament and howl: I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and a mourning like the ostriches.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Because her wound is desperate, because it is come even to Juda, it hath touched the gate of my people even to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Declare ye it not in Geth, weep ye not with tears: in the house of Dust sprinkle yourselves with dust.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And pass away, O thou that dwellest in the Beautiful place, covered with thy shame: she went not forth that dwelleth in the confines: the House adjoining shall receive mourning from you, which stood by herself.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For she is become weak unto good that dwelleth in bitterness: for evil is come down from the Lord into the gate of Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>A tumult of chariots hath astonished the inhabitants of Lachis: it is the beginning of sin to the daughter of Sion, for in thee were found the crimes of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Therefore shall she send messengers to the inheritance of Geth: the houses of lying to deceive the kings of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Yet will I bring an heir to thee that dwellest in Maresa: even to Odollam shall the glory of Israel come.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Make thee bald, and be polled for thy delicate children: enlarge thy baldness as the eagle: for they are carried into captivity from thee. </div><ul class='tnav'>
