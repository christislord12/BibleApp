Are not my words good to him that walketh uprightly?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But my people, on the contrary, are risen up as an enemy: you have taken away the cloak off from the coat: and them that passed harmless you have turned to war.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>You have cast out the women of my people from their houses, in which they took delight: you have taken my praise for ever from their children.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Arise ye, and depart, for there is no rest here for you. For that uncleanness of the land, it shall be corrupted with a grievous corruption.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Would God I were not a man that hath the spirit, and that I rather spoke a lie: I will let drop to thee of wine, and of drunkenness: and it shall be this people upon whom it shall drop.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I will assemble and gather together all of thee, O Jacob: I will bring together the remnant of Israel, I will put them together as a flock in the fold, as the sheep in the midst of the sheepcotes, they shall make a tumult by reason of the multitude of men.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For he shall go up that shall open the way before them: they shall divide, and pass through the gate, and shall come in by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the Lord at the head of them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
