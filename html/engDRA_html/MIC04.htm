Hast thou no king in thee, or is thy counsellor perished, because sorrow hath taken thee as a woman in labour?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Be in pain and labour, O daughter of Sion, as a woman that bringeth forth: for now shalt thou go out of the city, and shalt dwell in the country, and shalt come even to Babylon, there thou shalt be delivered: there the Lord will redeem thee out of the hand of thy enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And now many nations are gathered together against thee, and they say: Let her be stoned: and let our eye look upon Sion.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But they have not known the thoughts of the Lord, and have not understood his counsel: because he hath gathered them together as the hay of the floor.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Arise, and tread, O daughter of Sion: for I will make thy horn iron, and thy hoofs I will make brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces many peoples, and shalt immolate the spoils of them to the Lord, and their strength to the Lord of the whole earth. </div><ul class='tnav'>
