</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>As it is written in Isaias the prophet: Behold I send my angel before thy face, who shall prepare the way before thee.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>A voice of one crying in the desert: Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>John was in the desert baptizing, and preaching the baptism of penance, unto remission of sins.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And there went out to him all the country of Judea, and all they of Jerusalem, and were baptized by him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and he ate locusts and wild honey.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And he preached, saying: There cometh after me one mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and loose.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I have baptized you with water; but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And it came to pass, in those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And forthwith coming up out of he water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit as a dove descending, and remaining on him.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And there came a voice from heaven: Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And immediately the Spirit drove him out into the desert.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And he was in the desert forty days and forty nights, and was tempted by Satan; and he was with beasts, and the angels ministered to him.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And after that John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And saying: The time is accomplished, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent, and believe the gospel.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And passing by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother, casting nets into the sea (for they were fishermen).  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Jesus said to them: Come after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And immediately leaving their nets, they followed him.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And going on from thence a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were mending their nets in the ship:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And forthwith he called them. And leaving their father Zebedee in the ship with his hired men, they followed him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And they entered into Capharnaum, and forthwith upon the sabbath days going into the synagogue, he taught them.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And they were astonished at his doctrine. For he was teaching them as one having power, and not as the scribes.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Saying: What have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know who thou art, the Holy One of God.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Jesus threatened him, saying: Speak no more, and go out of the man.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the unclean spirit tearing him, and crying out with a loud voice, went out of him.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying: What thing is this? what is this new doctrine? for with power he commandeth even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the fame of him was spread forthwith into all the country of Galilee.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And immediately going out of the synagogue they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Simon’s wife’s mother lay in a fit of a fever: and forthwith they tell him of her.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And coming to her, he lifted her up, taking her by the hand; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And when it was evening, after sunset, they brought to him all that were ill and that were possessed with devils.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And all the city was gathered together at the door.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And he healed many that were troubled with divers diseases; and he cast out many devils, and he suffered them not to speak, because they knew him.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And rising very early, going out, he went into a desert place: and there he prayed.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And Simon, and they that were with him, followed after him.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And when they had found him, they said to him: All seek for thee.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And he saith to them: Let us go into the neighbouring towns and cities, that I may preach there also; for to this purpose am I come.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And he was preaching in their synagogues, and in all Galilee, and casting out devils.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down said to him: If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And Jesus having compassion on him, stretched forth his hand; and touching him, saith to him: I will. Be thou made clean.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And when he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And he strictly charged him, and forthwith sent him away.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And he saith to him: See thou tell no one; but go, shew thyself to the high priest, and offer for thy cleansing the things that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>But he being gone out, began to publish and to blaze abroad the word: so that he could not openly go into the city, but was without in desert places: and they flocked to him from all sides. </div><ul class='tnav'>
