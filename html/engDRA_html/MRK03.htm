But they held their peace.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And looking round about on them with anger, being grieved for the blindness of their hearts, he saith to the man: Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth: and his hand was restored unto him.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the Pharisees going out, immediately made a consultation with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But Jesus retired with his disciples to the sea; and a great multitude followed him from Galilee and Judea,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and from beyond the Jordan. And they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing the things which he did, came to him.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he spoke to his disciples that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For he healed many, so that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had evils.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him: and they cried, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Thou art the Son of God. And he strictly charged them that they should not make him known.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And going up into a mountain, he called unto him whom he would himself: and they came to him.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he made that twelve should be with him, and that he might send them to preach.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he gave them power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And to Simon he gave the name Peter:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he named them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Andrew and Philip, and Bartholomew and Matthew, and Thomas and James of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Cananean:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And they come to a house, and the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And when his friends had heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him. For they said: He is become mad.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the scribes who were come down from Jerusalem, said: He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of devils he casteth out devils.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And after he had called them together, he said to them in parables: How can Satan cast out Satan?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And if Satan be risen up against himself, he is divided, and cannot stand, but hath an end.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>No man can enter into the house of a strong man and rob him of his goods, unless he first bind the strong man, and then shall he plunder his house.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Amen I say to you, that all sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and the blasphemies wherewith they shall blaspheme:  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost, shall never have forgiveness, but shall be guilty of an everlasting sin.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Because they said: He hath an unclean spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And his mother and his brethren came; and standing without, sent unto him, calling him.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the multitude sat about him; and they say to him: Behold thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And answering them, he said: Who is my mother and my brethren?  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And looking round about on them who sat about him, he saith: Behold my mother and my brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>For whosoever shall do the will of God, he is my brother, and my sister, and mother. </div><ul class='tnav'>
