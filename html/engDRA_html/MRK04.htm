In what measure you shall mete, it shall be measured to you again, and more shall be given to you.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, that also which he hath shall be taken away from him.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And he said: So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the earth,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And should sleep, and rise, night and day, and the seed should spring, and grow up whilst he knoweth not.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For the earth of itself bringeth forth fruit, first the blade, then the ear, afterwards the full corn in the ear.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And he said: To what shall we liken the kingdom of God? or to what parable shall we compare it?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>It is as a grain of mustard seed: which when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that are in the earth:  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches, so that the birds of the air may dwell under the shadow thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And with many such parables, he spoke to them the word, according as they were able to hear.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And without parable he did not speak unto them; but apart, he explained all things to his disciples.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And he saith to them that day, when evening was come: Let us pass over to the other side.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And sending away the multitude, they take him even as he was in the ship: and there were other ships with him.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that the ship was filled.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And he was in the hinder part of the ship, sleeping upon a pillow; and they awake him, and say to him: Master, doth it not concern thee that we perish?  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And rising up, he rebuked the wind, and said to the sea: Peace, be still. And the wind ceased: and there was made a great calm.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And he said to them: Why are you fearful? have you not faith yet? And they feared exceedingly: and they said one to another: Who is this (thinkest thou) that both wind and sea obey him? </div><ul class='tnav'>
