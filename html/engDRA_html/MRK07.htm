<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 7</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And there assembled together unto him the Pharisees and some of the scribes, coming from Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And when they had seen some of his disciples eat bread with common, that is, with unwashed hands, they found fault.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For the Pharisees, and all the Jews eat not without often washing their hands, holding the tradition of the ancients:  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And when they come from the market, unless they be washed, they eat not: and many other things there are that have been delivered to them to observe, the washings of cups and of pots, and of brazen vessels, and of beds.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the Pharisees and scribes asked him: Why do not thy disciples walk according to the tradition of the ancients, but they eat bread with common hands?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But he answering, said to them: Well did Isaias prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written: This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And in vain to they worship me, teaching doctrines and precepts of men.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For leaving the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men, the washing of pots and of cups: and many other things you do like to these.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he said to them: Well do you make void the commandment of God, that you may keep your own tradition.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For Moses said: Honour thy father and thy mother; and He that shall curse father or mother, dying let him die.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But you say: If a man shall say to his father or mother, Corban, (which is a gift,) whatsoever is from me, shall profit thee.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And further you suffer him not to do any thing for his father or mother,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Making void the word of God by your own tradition, which you have given forth. And many other such like things you do.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And calling again the multitude unto him, he said to them: Hear ye me all, and understand.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>There is nothing from without a man that entering into him, can defile him. But the things which come from a man, those are they that defile a man.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And when he was come into the house from the multitude, his disciples asked him the parable.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he saith to them: So are you also without knowledge? understand you not that every thing from without, entering into a man cannot defile him:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Because it entereth not into his heart, but goeth into the belly, and goeth out into the privy, purging all meats?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But he said that the things which come out from a man, they defile a man.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For from within out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>All these evil things come from within, and defile a man.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And rising from thence he went into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon: and entering into a house, he would that no man should know it, and he could not be hid.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For a woman as soon as she heard of him, whose daughter had an unclean spirit, came in and fell down at his feet.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For the woman was a Gentile, a Syrophenician born. And she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Who said to her: Suffer first the children to be filled: for it is not good to take the bread of the children, and cast it to the dogs.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But she answered and said to him: Yea, Lord; for the whelps also eat under the table of the crumbs of the children.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And he said to her: For this saying go thy way, the devil is gone out of thy daughter.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And when she was come into her house, she found the girl lying upon the bed, and that the devil was gone out.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And again going out of the coasts of Tyre, he came by Sidon to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And they bring to him one deaf and dumb; and they besought him that he would lay his hand upon him.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And taking him from the multitude apart, he put his fingers into his ears, and spitting, he touched his tongue:  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And looking up to heaven, he groaned, and said to him: Ephpheta, which is, Be thou opened.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And immediately his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke right.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And he charged them that they should tell no man. But the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal did they publish it.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And so much the more did they wonder, saying: He hath done all things well; he hath made both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak. </div><ul class='tnav'>
