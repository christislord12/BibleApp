<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 14</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Now the feast of the pasch, and of the Azymes was after two days; and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might by some wile lay hold on him, and kill him.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>But they said: Not on the festival day, lest there should be a tumult among the people.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And when he was in Bethania, in the house of Simon the leper, and was at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of precious spikenard: and breaking the alabaster box, she poured it out upon his head.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Now there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said: Why was this waste of the ointment made?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For this ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and given to the poor. And they murmured against her.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But Jesus said: Let her alone, why do you molest her? She hath wrought a good work upon me.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For the poor you have always with you: and whensoever you will, you may do them good: but me you have not always.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>She hath done what she could: she is come beforehand to anoint my body for burial.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Amen, I say to you, wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which she hath done, shall be told for a memorial of her.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests, to betray him to them.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Who hearing it were glad; and they promised him they would give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Now on the first day of the unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the pasch, the disciples say to him: Whither wilt thou that we go, and prepare for thee to eat the pasch?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And he sendeth two of his disciples, and saith to them: Go ye into the city; and there shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water, follow him;  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And whithersoever he shall go in, say to the master of the house, The master saith, Where is my refectory, where I may eat the pasch with my disciples?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he will shew you a large dining room furnished; and there prepare ye for us.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And his disciples went their way, and came into the city; and they found as he had told them, and they prepared the pasch.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And when evening was come, he cometh with the twelve.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And when they were at table and eating, Jesus saith: Amen I say to you, one of you that eateth with me shall betray me.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But they began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one by one: Is it I?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Who saith to them: One of the twelve, who dippeth with me his hand in the dish.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed. It were better for him, if that man had not been born.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And whilst they were eating, Jesus took bread; and blessing, broke, and gave to them, and said: Take ye. This is my body.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And having taken the chalice, giving thanks, he gave it to them. And they all drank of it.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he said to them: This is my blood of the new testament, which shall be shed for many.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Amen I say to you, that I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I shall drink it new in the kingdom of God.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And when they had said an hymn, they went forth to the mount of Olives.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Jesus saith to them: You will all be scandalized in my regard this night; for it is written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep shall be dispersed.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But after I shall be risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>But Peter saith to him: Although all shall be scandalized in thee, yet not I.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Jesus saith to him: Amen I say to thee, today, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shall deny me thrice.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>But he spoke the more vehemently: Although I should die together with thee, I will not deny thee. And in like manner also said they all.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And they came to a farm called Gethsemani. And he saith to his disciples: Sit you here, while I pray.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And he taketh Peter and James and John with him; and he began to fear and to be heavy.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And he saith to them: My soul is sorrowful even unto death; stay you here, and watch.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And when he was gone forward a little, he fell flat on the ground; and he prayed, that if it might be, the hour might pass from him.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And he saith: Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee: remove this chalice from me; but not what I will, but what thou wilt.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping. And he saith to Peter: Simon, sleepest thou? couldst thou not watch one hour?  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Watch ye, and pray that you enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>A going away again, he prayed, saying the same words.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And when he returned, he found them again asleep, (for their eyes were heavy,) and they knew not what to answer him.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And he cometh the third time, and saith to them: Sleep ye now, and take your rest. It is enough: the hour is come: behold the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Rise up, let us go. Behold, he that will betray me is at hand.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And while he was yet speaking, cometh Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve: and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the ancients.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And he that betrayed him, had given them a sign, saying: Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he; lay hold on him, and lead him away carefully.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And when he was come, immediately going up to him, he saith: Hail, Rabbi; and he kissed him.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>But they laid hands on him, and held him.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>An one of them that stood by, drawing a sword, struck a servant of the chief priest, and cut off his ear.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>And Jesus answering, said to them: Are you come out as to a robber, with swords and staves to apprehend me?  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you did not lay hands on me. But that the scriptures may be fulfilled.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Then his disciples leaving him, all fled away.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>And a certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and they laid hold on him.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>But he, casting off the linen cloth, fled from them naked.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>And they brought Jesus to the high priest; and all the priests and the scribes and the ancients assembled together.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>And Peter followed him from afar off, even into the court of the high priest; and he sat with the servants at the fire, and warmed himself.  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>And the chief priests and all the council sought for evidence against Jesus, that they might put him to death, and found none.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>For many bore false witness against him, and their evidences were not agreeing.  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>And some rising up, bore false witness against him, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>We heard him say, I will destroy this temple made with hands, and within three days I will build another not made with hands.  <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>And their witness did not agree.  <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>And the high priest rising up in the midst, asked Jesus, saying: Answerest thou nothing to the things that are laid to thy charge by these men?  <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said to him: Art thou the Christ the Son of the blessed God?  <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>And Jesus said to him: I am. And you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of the power of God, and coming with the clouds of heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>Then the high priest rending his garments, saith: What need we any further witnesses?  <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#160;</span>You have heard the blasphemy. What think you? Who all condemned him to be guilty of death.  <span class="verse" id="V65">65&#160;</span>And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him: Prophesy: and the servants struck him with the palms of their hands.  <span class="verse" id="V66">66&#160;</span>Now when Peter was in the court below, there cometh one of the maidservants of the high priest.  <span class="verse" id="V67">67&#160;</span>And when she had seen Peter warming himself, looking on him she saith: Thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.  <span class="verse" id="V68">68&#160;</span>But he denied, saying: I neither know nor understand what thou sayest. And he went forth before the court; and the cock crew.  <span class="verse" id="V69">69&#160;</span>And again a maidservant seeing him, began to say to the standers by: This is one of them.  <span class="verse" id="V70">70&#160;</span>But he denied again. And after a while they that stood by said again to Peter: Surely thou art one of them; for thou art also a Galilean.  <span class="verse" id="V71">71&#160;</span>But he began to curse and to swear, saying; I know not this man of whom you speak.  <span class="verse" id="V72">72&#160;</span>And immediately the cock crew again. And Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said unto him: Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt thrice deny me. And he began to weep. </div><ul class='tnav'>
