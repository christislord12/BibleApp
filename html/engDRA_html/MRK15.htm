But he answering, saith to him: Thou sayest it.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And the chief priests accused him in many things.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And Pilate again asked him, saying: Answerest thou nothing? behold in how many things they accuse thee.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But Jesus still answered nothing; so that Pilate wondered.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Now on the festival day he was wont to release unto them one of the prisoners, whomsoever they demanded.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And there was one called Barabbas, who was put in prison with some seditious men, who in the sedition had committed murder.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And when the multitude was come up, they began to desire that he would do, as he had ever done unto them.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Pilate answered them, and said: Will you that I release to you the king of the Jews?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him up out of envy.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas to them.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Pilate again answering, saith to them: What will you then that I do to the king of the Jews?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But they again cried out: Crucify him.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Pilate saith to them: Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more: Crucify him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And so Pilate being willing to satisfy the people, released to them Barabbas, and delivered up Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the soldiers led him away into the court of the palace, and they called together the whole band:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And they clothe him with purple, and platting a crown of thorns, they put it upon him.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And they began to salute him: Hail, king of the Jews.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And they struck his head with a reed: and they did spit on him. And bowing their knees, they adored him.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And after they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own garments on him, and they led him out to crucify him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And they forced one Simon a Cyrenian who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and of Rufus, to take up his cross.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And they bring him into the place called Golgotha, which being interpreted is, The place of Calvary.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh; but he took it not.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And crucifying him, they divided his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the inscription of his cause was written over: THE KING OF THE JEWS.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith: And with the wicked he was reputed.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And they that passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying: Vah, thou that destroyest the temple of God, and in three days buildest it up again;  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Save thyself, coming down from the cross.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>In like manner also the chief priests mocking, said with the scribes one to another: He saved others; himself he cannot save.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Let Christ the king of Israel come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole earth until the ninth hour.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And at the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying: Eloi, Eloi, lamma sabacthani? Which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And some of the standers by hearing, said: Behold he calleth Elias.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And one running and filling a sponge with vinegar, and putting it upon a reed, gave him to drink, saying: Stay, let us see if Elias come to take him down.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And Jesus having cried out with a loud voice, gave up the ghost.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And the veil of the temple was rent in two, from the top to the bottom.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And the centurion who stood over against him, seeing that crying out in this manner he had given up the ghost, said: Indeed this man was the son of God.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And there were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joseph, and Salome:  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Who also when he was in Galilee followed him, and ministered to him, and many other women that came up with him to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And when evening was now come, (because it was the Parasceve, that is, the day before the sabbath,)  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Joseph of Arimathea, a noble counsellor, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, came and went in boldly to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>But Pilate wondered that he should be already dead. And sending for the centurion, he asked him if he were already dead.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And when he had understood it by the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And Joseph buying fine linen, and taking him down, wrapped him up in the fine linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewed out of a rock. And he rolled a stone to the door of the sepulchre.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of Joseph, beheld where he was laid. </div><ul class='tnav'>
