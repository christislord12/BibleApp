<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 16</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought sweet spices, that coming, they might anoint Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And very early in the morning, the first day of the week, they come to the sepulchre, the sun being now risen.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And they said one to another: Who shall roll us back the stone from the door of the sepulchre?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And looking, they saw the stone rolled back. For it was very great.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed with a white robe: and they were astonished.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Who saith to them: Be not affrighted; you seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified: he is risen, he is not here, behold the place where they laid him.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee; there you shall see him, as he told you.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But they going out, fled from the sepulchre. For a trembling and fear had seized them: and they said nothing to any man; for they were afraid.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But he rising early the first day of the week, appeared first to Mary Magdalen, out of whom he had cast seven devils.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>She went and told them that had been with him, who were mourning and weeping.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And they hearing that he was alive, and had been seen by her, did not believe.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And after that he appeared in another shape to two of them walking, as they were going into the country.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And they going told it to the rest: neither did they believe them.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>At length he appeared to the eleven as they were at table: and he upbraided them with their incredulity and hardness of heart, because they did not believe them who had seen him after he was risen again.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he said to them: Go ye into the whole world, and preach the gospel to every creature.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved: but he that believeth not shall be condemned.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And these signs shall follow them that believe: In my name they shall cast out devils: they shall speak with new tongues.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>They shall take up serpents; and if they shall drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them: they shall lay their hands upon the sick, and they shall recover.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of God.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But they going forth preached every where: the Lord working withal, and confirming the word with signs that followed. </div><ul class='tnav'>
