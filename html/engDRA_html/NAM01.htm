The book of the vision of Nahum the Elcesite.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The Lord is a jealous God, and a revenger: the Lord is a revenger, and hath wrath: the Lord taketh vengeance on his adversaries, and he is angry with his enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The Lord is patient, and great in power, and will not cleanse and acquit the guilty. The Lord’s ways are in a tempest, and a whirlwind, and clouds are the dust of his feet.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>He rebuketh the sea, and drieth it up: and bringeth all the rivers to be a desert. Basan languisheth and Carmel: and the dower of Libanus fadeth away.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The mountains tremble at him, and the hills are made desolate: and the earth hath quaked at his presence, and the world, and all that dwell therein.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Who can stand before the face of his indignation? and who shall resist in the fierceness of his anger? his indignation is poured out like fire: and the rocks are melted by him.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The Lord is good and giveth strength in the day of trouble: and knoweth them that hope in him.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But with a flood that passeth by, he will make an utter end of the place thereof: and darkness shall pursue his enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>What do ye devise against the Lord? he will make an utter end: there shall not rise a double affliction.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For as thorns embrace one another: so while they are feasting and drinking together, they shall be consumed as stubble that is fully dry.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Out of thee shall come forth one that imagineth evil against the Lord, contriving treachery in his mind.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord: Though they were perfect: and many of them so, yet thus shall they be cut off, and he shall pass: I have afflicted thee, and I will afflict thee no more.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And now I will break in pieces his rod with which he struck thy back, and I will burst thy bonds asunder.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the Lord will give a commandment concerning thee, that no more of thy name shall be sown: I will destroy the graven and molten thing out of the house of thy God, I will make it thy grave, for thou art disgraced.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, and that preacheth peace: O Juda, keep thy festivals, and pay thy vows: for Belial shall no more pass through thee again, he is utterly cut off. </div><ul class='tnav'>
