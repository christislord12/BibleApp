They cry: Stand, stand, but there is none that will return back.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Take ye the spoil of the silver, take the spoil of the gold: for there is no end of the riches of all the precious furniture.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>She is destroyed, and rent, and torn: the heart melteth, and the knees fail, and all the loins lose their strength: and the faces of them all are as the blackness of a kettle.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Where is now the dwelling of the lions, and the feeding place of the young lions, to which the lion went, to enter in thither, the young lion, and there was none to make them afraid?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The lion caught enough for his whelps, and killed for his lionesses: and he filled his holes with prey, and his den with rapine.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Behold I come against thee, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will burn thy chariots even to smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions: and I will cut off thy prey out of the land, and the voice of thy messengers shall be heard no more. </div><ul class='tnav'>
