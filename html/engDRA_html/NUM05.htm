And the woman shall answer, Amen, amen.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and shall wash them out with the most bitter waters, upon which he hath heaped the curses,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he shall give them her to drink. And when she hath drunk them up,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The priest shall take from her hand the sacrifice of jealousy, and shall elevate it before the Lord, and shall put it upon the altar: yet so as first,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>To take a handful of the sacrifice of that which is offered, and burn it upon the altar: and so give the most bitter waters to the woman to drink.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And when she hath drunk them, if she be defiled, and having despised her husband be guilty of adultery, the malediction shall go through her, and her belly swelling, her thigh shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse, and an example to all the people.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But if she be not defiled, she shall not be hurt, and shall bear children.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>This is the law of jealousy. If a woman hath gone aside from her husband, and be defiled,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And the husband stirred up by the spirit of jealousy bring her before the Lord, and the priest do to her according to all things that are here written:  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The husband shall be blameless, and she shall bear her iniquity. </div><ul class='tnav'>
