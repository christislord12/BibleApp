For every lamb,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And for every ram there shall be a sacrifice of hour of two tenths, which shall be tempered with the third part of a hin of oil:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And he shall offer the third part of the same measure of wine for the libation, for a sweet savour to the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But when thou offerest a holocaust or sacrifice of oxen, to fulfill thy vow or for victims of peace offerings,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Thou shalt give for every ox three tenths of flour tempered with half a hin of oil,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And wine for libations of the same measure, for an offering of most sweet savour to the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Thus shalt thou do:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For every ox and ram and lamb and kid.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Both they that are born in the land, and the strangers,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Shall offer sacrifices after the same rite.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>There shall be all one law and judgment both for you and for them who are strangers in the land.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>When you are come into the land which I will give you,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And shall eat of the bread of that country, you shall separate firstfruits to the Lord,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Of the things you eat. As you separate firstfruits of your barnfloors:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>So also shall you give firstfruits of your dough to the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And if through ignorance you omit any of these things, which the Lord hath spoken to Moses,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And by him hath commanded you, from the day that he began to command and thenceforward,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the multitude have forgotten to do it: they shall offer a calf out of the herd, a holocaust for a most sweet savour to the Lord, and the sacrifice and libations thereof, as the ceremonies require, and a buck goat for sin:  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And the priest shall pray for all the multitude of the children of Israel: and it shall be forgiven them, because they sinned ignorantly, offering notwithstanding a burnt offering to the Lord for themselves and for their sin and their ignorance:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And it shall be forgiven all the people of the children of Israel: and the strangers that sojourn among them: because it is the fault of all the people through ignorance.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But if one soul shall sin ignorantly, he shall offer a she goat of a year old for his sin.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the priest shall pray for him, because he sinned ignorantly before the Lord: and he shall obtain his pardon, and it shall be forgiven him.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>The same law shall be for all that sin by ignorance, whether they be natives or strangers.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But the soul that committeth any thing through pride, whether he be born in the land or a stranger (because he hath been rebellious against the Lord) shall be cut off from among his people:  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For he hath contemned the word the Lord, and made void his precept: therefore shall he be destroyed, and shall bear his iniquity.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when the children of Israel were in the wilderness, and had found a man gathering sticks on the sabbath day,  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>That they brought him to Moses and Aaron and the whole multitude.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And they put him into prison, not knowing what they should do with him.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Moses: Let that man die, let all the multitude stone him without the camp.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And when they had brought him out, they stoned him, and he died as the Lord had commanded.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>The Lord also said to Moses:  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt tell them I to make to themselves fringes in the corners of their garments, putting in them ribands of blue:  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>That when they shall see them, they may remember all the commandments of the Lord, and not follow their own thoughts and eyes going astray after divers things,  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>But rather being mindful of the precepts of the Lord, may do them and be holy to their God.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that I might be your God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
