But they answered: We will not come.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Is it a small matter to thee, that thou hast brought us out of a land that flowed with milk and honey, to kill us in the desert, except thou rule also like a lord over us?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Thou best brought us indeed into a land that floweth with rivers of milk and honey, and hast given us possessions of fields and vineyards; wilt thou also pull out our eyes? We will not come.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Moses therefore being very angry, raid to the Lord: Respect not their sacrifices: thou knowest that I have not taken of them so much as a young ass at any time, nor have injured any of them.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And he said to Core: Do thou and thy congregation stand apart before the Lord tomorrow, and Aaron apart.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Take every one of you censers, and put incense upon them, offering to the Lord two hundred and fifty censers: let Aaron also hold his censer.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>When they had done this, Moses and Aaron standing,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And had drawn up all the multitude against them to the door of the tabernacle, the glory of the Lord appeared to them all.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the Lord speaking to Moses and Aaron, said:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may presently destroy them.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>They fell flat on their face, and said: O most mighty, the God of the spirits of all flesh, for one man’s sin shall thy wrath rage against all?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Moses:  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Command the whole people to separate themselves from the tents of Core and Dathan and Abiron.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Moses arose, and went to Dathan and Abiron: and the ancients of Israel following him,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>He said to the multitude: Depart from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be involved in their sins.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And when they were departed from their tents round about, Dathan and Abiron coming out stood in the entry of their pavilions with their wives and children, and all the people.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Moses said: By this you shall know that the Lord hath sent me to do all things that you see, and that I have not forged them of my own head:  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>If these men die the common death of men, and if they be visited with a plague, wherewith others also are wont to be visited, the Lord did not send me.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But if the Lord do a new thing, and the earth opening her mouth swallow them down, and all things that belong to them, and they go down alive into hell, you shall know that they have blasphemed the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And immediately as he had made an end of speaking, the earth broke asunder under their feet:  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And opening her mouth, devoured them with their tents and all their substance.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And they went down alive into hell the ground closing upon them, and they perished from among the people.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But all Israel, that was standing round about, fled at the cry of them that were perishing: saying: Lest perhaps the earth swallow us up also.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And a fire coming out from the Lord, destroyed the two hundred and fifty men that offered the incense.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Command Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest to take up the censers that lie in the burning, and to scatter the fire of one side and the other: because they are sanctified  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>In the deaths of the sinners: and let him beat them into plates, and fasten them to the altar, because incense hath been offered in them to the Lord, and they are sanctified, that the children of Israel may see them for a sign and a memorial.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Then Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers, wherein they had offered, whom the burning fire had devoured, and beat them into plates, fastening them to the altar:  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>That the children of Israel might have for the time to come wherewith they should be admonished, that no stranger or any one that is not of seed of Aaron should come near to offer incense to the Lord, lest he should suffer as Core suffered, and all his congregation, according as the Lord spoke to Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>The following day all the multitude of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron, saying: You have killed the people of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And when there arose a sedition, and the tumult increased,  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Moses and Aaron fled to the tabernacle of the covenant. And when the were gone into it, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the Lord appeared.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Moses:  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Get you out from the midst of this multitude, this moment will I destroy them. And as they were lying on the ground,  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Moses said to Aaron: Take the censer, and putting fire in it from the altar, put incense upon it, and go quickly to the people to pray for them: for already wrath is gone out from the Lord, and the plague rageth.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>When Aaron had done this, and had run to the midst of the multitude which the burning fire was now destroying, he offered the incense:  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>And standing between the dead and the living, he prayed for the people, and the plague ceased.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>And the number of them that were slain was fourteen thousand and seven hundred men, besides them that had perished in the sedition of Core.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>And Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the tabernacle of the covenant after the destruction was over. </div><ul class='tnav'>
