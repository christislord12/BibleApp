But the rest of the things for use they carried to the camp on the plains of Moab, beside the Jordan over against Jericho.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the princes of the synagogue went forth to meet them without the camp.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Moses being angry with the chief officers of the army, the tribunes, and the centurions that were come from the battle,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Said: Why have you saved the women?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Are not these they, that deceived the children of Israel by the counsel of Balaam, and made you transgress against the Lord by the sin of Phogor, for which also the people was punished?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Therefore kill all that are of the male sex, even of the children: and put to death the women, that have carnally known men.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But the girls, and all the women that are virgins save for yourselves:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And stay without the camp seven days. He that hath killed a man, or touched one that is killed, shall be purified the third day and the seventh day.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And of all the spoil, every garment, or vessel, or any thing made for use, of the skins, or hair of goats, or of wood, shall be purified.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Eleazar also the priest spoke to the men of the army, that had fought, in this manner: This is the ordinance of the law, which the Lord hath commanded Moses:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Gold, and silver, and brass, and iron, and lend, and tin,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And all that may pass through the fire, shall be purified by fire, but whatsoever cannot abide the fire, shall be sanctified with the water of expiation:  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And you shall wash your garments the seventh day, and being purified, you shall afterwards enter into the camp.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Moses:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Take the sum of the things that were taken both of man and beast, thou and Eleazar the priest and the princes of the multitude:  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And thou shalt divide the spoil equally, between them that fought and went out to the war, and between the rest of the multitude.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And thou shalt separate a portion to the Lord from them that fought and were in the battle, one soul of five hundred as well of persons as of oxen and asses and sheep.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And thou shalt give it to Eleazar the priest, because they are the firstfruits of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Out of the moiety also of the children of Israel thou shalt take the fiftieth head of persons, and of oxen, and asses, and sheep, and of all beasts, and thou shalt give them to the Levites that watch in the charge of the tabernacle of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And Moses and Eleazar did as the Lord had commanded.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the spoil which the army had taken, was six hundred seventy-five thousand sheep,  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Seventy-two thousand oxen,  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Sixty-one thousand asses:  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And thirty-two thousand persons of the female sex, that had not known men.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And one half was given to them that had been in the battle, to wit, three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep:  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Out of which, for the portion of the Lord, were reckoned six hundred seventy-five sheep.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And out of the thirty-six thousand oxen, seventy-two oxen:  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Out of the thirty thousand five hundred asses, sixty-one asses:  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Out of the sixteen thousand persons, there fell to the portion of the Lord, thirty-two souls.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And Moses delivered the number of the firstfruits of the Lord to Eleazar the priest, as had been commanded him,  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Out of the half of the children of Israel, which he had separated for them that had been in the battle.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>But out of the half that fell to the rest of the multitude, that is to say, out of the three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep,  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And out of the thirty-six thousand oxen,  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And out of the thirty thousand five hundred asses,  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And out of the sixteen thousand persons,  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Moses took the fiftieth head, and gave it to the Levites that watched in the tabernacle of the Lord, as the Lord had commanded.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>And when the commanders of the army, and the tribunes and centurions were come to Moses, they said:  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>We thy servants have reckoned up the number of the fighting men, whom we had under our hand, and not so much as one was wanting.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Therefore we offer as gifts to the Lord what gold every one of us could find in the booty, in garters and tablets, rings and bracelets, and chains, that thou mayst pray to the Lord for us.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>And Moses and Eleazar the priest received all the gold in divers kinds,  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>In weight sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty sicles, from the tribunes and from the centurions.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>For that which every one had taken in the booty was his own.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>And that which was received they brought into the tabernacle of the testimony, for a memorial of the children of Israel before the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
