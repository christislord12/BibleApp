These shall be the borders on the north side.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>From thence they shall mark out the bounds towards the east side from the village of Enan unto Sephama.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And from Sephama the bounds shall go down to Rebla over against the fountain of Daphnis: from thence they shall come eastward to the sea of Cenereth,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And shall reach as far as the Jordan, and at the last shall be closed in by the most salt sea. This shall be your land with its borders round about.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying: This shall be the land which you shall possess by lot, and which the Lord hath commanded to be given to the nine tribes, and to the half tribe.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For the tribe of the children of Ruben by their families, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the number of their kindreds, and half of the tribe of Manasses,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>That is, two tribes and a half, have received their portion beyond the Jordan over against Jericho at the east side.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Moses:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>These are the names of the men, that shall divide the land unto you: Eleazar the priest, and Josue the son of Nun,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And one prince of every tribe,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Whose names are these: Of the tribe of Juda, Caleb the son of Jephone.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Of the tribe of Simeon, Samuel the son of Ammiud.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chaselon.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Of the tribe of the children of Dan, Bocci the son of Jogli.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Of the children of Joseph of the tribe of Manasses, Hanniel the son of Ephod.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Of the tribe of Ephraim, Camuel the son of Sephtan.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Of the tribe of Zabulon, Elisaphan the son of Pharnach.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Of the tribe of Issachar, Phaltiel the prince, the son of Ozan.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Of the tribe of Aser, Ahiud the son of Salomi.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Of the tribe of Nephtali: Phedael the son of Ammiud.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>These are they whom the Lord hath commanded to divide the land of Chanaan to the children of Israel. </div><ul class='tnav'>
