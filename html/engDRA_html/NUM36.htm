For all men shall marry wives of their own tribe and kindred:  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And all women shall take husbands of the same tribe: that the inheritance may remain in the families,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And that the tribes be not mingled one with another, but remain so  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>As they were separated by the Lord. And the daughters of Salphaad did as was commanded:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Maala, and Thersa, and Hegla, and Melcha, and Noa were married to the sons of their uncle by their father,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Of the family of Manasses, who was the son of Joseph: and the possession that had been allotted to them, remained in the tribe and family of their father.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>These are the commandments and judgments, which the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses to the children of Israel, in the plains of Moab upon the Jordan over against Jericho. </div><ul class='tnav'>
