<div class='mt'>Paul’s Letter to Philemon  
</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy, a brother: to Philemon, our beloved and fellow labourer;  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And to Appia, our dearest sister, and to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the church which is in thy house:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I give thanks to my God, always making a remembrance of thee in my prayers.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Hearing of thy charity and faith, which thou hast in the Lord Jesus, and towards all the saints:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>That the communication of thy faith may be made evident in the acknowledgment of every good work, that is in you in Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For I have had great joy and consolation in thy charity, because the bowels of the saints have been refreshed by thee, brother.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Wherefore though I have much confidence in Christ Jesus, to command thee that which is to the purpose:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For charity sake I rather beseech, whereas thou art such a one, as Paul an old man, and now a prisoner also of Jesus Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I beseech thee for my son, whom I have begotten in my bands, Onesimus,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Who hath been heretofore unprofitable to thee, but now is profitable both to me and thee,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Whom I have sent back to thee. And do thou receive him as my own bowels.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered to me in the bands of the gospel:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But without thy counsel I would do nothing: that thy good deed might not be as it were of necessity, but voluntary.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For perhaps he therefore departed for a season from thee, that thou mightest receive him again for ever:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Not now as a servant, but instead of a servant, a most dear brother, especially to me: but how much more to thee both in the flesh and in the Lord?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>If therefore thou count me a partner, receive him as myself.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And if he hath wronged thee in any thing, or is in thy debt, put that to my account.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>I Paul have written it with my own hand: I will repay it: not to say to thee, that thou owest me thy own self also.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Yea, brother. May I enjoy thee in the Lord. Refresh my bowels in the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Trusting in thy obedience, I have written to thee: knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But withal prepare me also a lodging. For I hope that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>There salute thee Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus;  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke my fellow labourers.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. </div><ul class='tnav'>
