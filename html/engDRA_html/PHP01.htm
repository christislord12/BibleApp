<div class='mt'>Paul’s Letter to the Philippians  
</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Paul and Timothy, the servants of Jesus Christ; to all the saints in Christ Jesus, who are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Grace be unto you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I give thanks to my God in every remembrance of you,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Always in all my prayers making supplication for you all, with joy;  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For your communication in the gospel of Christ from the first day until now.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Being confident of this very thing, that he, who hath begun a good work in you, will perfect it unto the day of Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>As it is meet for me to think this for you all, for that I have you in my heart; and that in my bands, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of my joy.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For God is my witness, how I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And this I pray, that your charity may more and more abound in knowledge, and in all understanding:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>That you may approve the better things, that you may be sincere and without offence unto the day of Christ,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Filled with the fruit of justice, through Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Now, brethren, I desire you should know, that the things which have happened to me, have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the gospel:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So that my bands are made manifest in Christ, in all the court, and in all other places;  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And many of the brethren in the Lord, growing confident by my bands, are much more bold to speak the word of God without fear.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Some indeed, even out of envy and contention; but some also for good will preach Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Some out of charity, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And some out of contention preach Christ not sincerely: supposing that they raise affliction to my bands.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But what then? So that by all means, whether by occasion, or by truth, Christ be preached: in this also I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For I know that this shall fall out to me unto salvation, through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>According to my expectation and hope; that in nothing I shall be confounded, but with all confidence, as always, so now also shall Christ be magnified in my body, wither it be by life, or by death.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For to me, to live is Christ; and to die is gain.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And if to live in the flesh, this is to me the fruit of labour, and what I shall choose I know not.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But I am straitened between two: having a desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ, a thing by far the better.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But to abide still in the flesh, is needful for you.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide, and continue with you all, for your furtherance and joy of faith:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>That your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus for me, by my coming to you again.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Only let your conversation be worthy of the gospel of Christ: that, whether I come and see you, or, being absent, may hear of you, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind labouring together for the faith of the gospel.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And in nothing be ye terrified by the adversaries: which to them is a cause of perdition, but to you of salvation, and this from God:  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For unto you it is given for Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Having the same conflict as that which you have seen in me, and now have heard of me. </div><ul class='tnav'>
