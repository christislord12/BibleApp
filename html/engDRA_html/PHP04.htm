The Lord is nigh.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Be nothing solicitous; but in every thing, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your petitions be made known to God.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the peace of God, which surpasseth all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For the rest, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever modest, whatsoever just, whatsoever holy, whatsoever lovely, whatsoever of good fame, if there be any virtue, if any praise of discipline, think on these things.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The things which you have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, these do ye, and the God of peace shall be with you.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Now I rejoice in the Lord exceedingly, that now at length your thought for me hath flourished again, as you did also think; but you were busied.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I speak not as it were for want. For I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, to be content therewith.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I know both how to be brought low, and I know how to abound: (everywhere, and in all things I am instructed) both to be full, and to be hungry; both to abound, and to suffer need.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I can do all these things in him who strengtheneth me.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Nevertheless you have done well in communicating to my tribulation.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And you also know, O Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For unto Thessalonica also you sent once and again for my use.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that may abound to your account.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But I have all, and abound: I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things you sent, an odour of sweetness, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And may my God supply all your want, according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Now to God and our Father be glory world without end. Amen.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Salute ye every saint in Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The brethren who are with me, salute you. All the saints salute you; especially they that are of Caesar’s household.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. </div><ul class='tnav'>
