Fools despise wisdom and instruction.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>That grace may be added to thy head, and a chain of gold to thy neck.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>My son, if sinners shall entice thee, consent not to them.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>If they shall say: Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood, let us hide snares for the innocent without cause:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Let us swallow him up alive like hell, and whole as one that goeth down into the pit.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoils.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Cast in thy lot with us, let us all have one purse.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>My son, walk not thou with them, restrain thy foot from their paths.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But a net is spread in vain before the eyes of them that have wings.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And they themselves lie in wait for their own blood, and practise deceits against their own souls.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>So the wage of every covetous man destroy the souls of the possessors.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Wisdom preacheth abroad, she uttereth her voice in the streets:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>At the head of multitudes she crieth out, in the entrance of the gates of the city she uttereth her words, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>O children, how long will you love childishness, and fools covet those things which are hurtful to themselves, and the unwise hate knowledge?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Turn ye at my reproof: behold I will utter my spirit to you, and will shew you my words.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Because I called, and you refused: I stretched out my hand, and there was none that regarded.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>You have despised all my counsel, and have neglected my reprehensions.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>I also will laugh in your destruction, and will mock when that shall come to you which you feared.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>When sudden calamity shall fall on you, and destruction, as a tempest, shall be at hand: when tribulation and distress shall come upon you:  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then shall they call upon me, and I will not hear: they shall rise in the morning and shall not find me:  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Because they have hated instruction and received not the fear of the Lord,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Nor consented to my counsel, but despised all my reproof.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Therefore they shall eat the fruit of their own way, and shall be filled with their own devices.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>The turning away of little ones shall kill them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>But he that shall hear me, shall rest without terror, and shall enjoy abundance, without fear of evils. </div><ul class='tnav'>
