Mind not the deceit of a woman.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For the lips of a harlot are like a honeycomb dropping, and her throat is smoother than oil.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But her end is bitter as wormwood, and sharp as a two-edged sword.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Her feet go down into death, and her steps go in as far as hell.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>They walk not by the path of life, her steps are wandering, and unaccountable.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Now therefore, my son, hear me, and depart not from the words of my mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the doors of her house.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Give not thy honour to strangers, and thy years to the cruel.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Lest strangers be filled with thy strength, and thy labours be in another man’s house,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And thou mourn it the last, when thou shalt have spent thy flesh and thy body, and say:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Why have I hated instruction, and my heart consented not to reproof,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And have not heard the voice of them that taught me, and have not inclined my ear to masters?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I have almost been in all evil, in the midst of the church and of the congregation.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Drink water out of thy own cistern, and the streams of thy own well:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Let thy fountains be conveyed abroad, and in the streets divide thy waters.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Keep them to thyself alone, neither let strangers be partakers with thee.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Let thy vein be blessed, and rejoice with the wife of thy youth:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Let her be thy dearest hind, and most agreeable fawn: let her breasts inebriate thee at all times; he thou delighted continually with her love.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Why art thou seduced, my son, by a strange woman, and art cherished in the bosom of another?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The Lord beholdeth the ways of man, and considereth all his steps.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>His own iniquities catch the wicked, and he is fast bound with the ropes of his own sins.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>He shall die, because he hath not received instruction, and in the multitude of his folly he shall be deceived. </div><ul class='tnav'>
