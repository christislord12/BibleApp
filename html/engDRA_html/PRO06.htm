<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 6</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, thou hast engaged fast thy hand to a stranger.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Thou art ensnared with the words of thy mouth, and caught with thy own words.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Do therefore, my son, what I say, and deliver thyself: because thou art fallen into the hand of thy neighbour. Run about, make haste, stir up thy friend:  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Give not sleep to thy eyes, neither let thy eyelids slumber.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Deliver thyself as a doe from the hand, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Go to the ant, O sluggard, and consider her ways, and learn wisdom:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Which, although she hath no guide, nor master, nor captain,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Provideth her meat for herself in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou rise out of thy sleep?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Thou wilt sleep a little, thou wilt slumber a little, thou wilt fold thy hands a little to sleep:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And want shall come upon thee, as a traveller, and poverty as a man armed. But if thou be diligent, thy harvest shall come as a fountain, and want shall flee far from thee.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>A man that is an apostate, an unprofitable man, walketh with a perverse mouth,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He winketh with the eyes, presseth with the foot, speaketh with the finger.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>With a wicked heart he deviseth evil, and at all times he soweth discord.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>To such a one his destruction shall presently come, and he shall suddenly be destroyed, and shall no longer have any remedy.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Six things there are, which the Lord hateth, and the seventh his soul detesteth:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>A heart that deviseth wicked plots, feet that are swift to run into mischief,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>A deceitful witness that uttereth lies, and him that soweth discord among brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>My son, beep the commandments of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Bind them in thy heart continually, and put them about thy neck.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>When thou walkest, let them go with thee: when thou sleepest, let them keep thee; and when thou awakest, talk with them.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Because the commandment is a lamp, and the law a light, and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>That they may keep thee from the evil woman, and from the flattering tongue of the stranger.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Let not thy heart covet her beauty, be not caught with her winks:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For the price of a harlot is scarce one loaf: but the woman catcheth the precious soul of a man.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Can a man hide fire in his bosom, and his garments not burn?  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Or can he walk upon hot coals, and his feet not be burnt?  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>So he that goeth in to his neighbour’s wife, shall not be clean when he shall touch her.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>The fault is not so great when a man hath stolen: for he stealeth to fill his hungry soul:  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And if he be taken he shall restore sevenfold, and shall give up all the substance of his house.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But he that is an adulterer, for the folly of his heart shall destroy his own soul:  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>He gathereth to himself shame and dishonour, and his reproach shall not be blotted out:  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Because the jealousy and rage of the husband will not spare in the day of revenge,  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Nor will he yield to any man’s prayers, nor will he accept for satisfaction ever so many gifts. </div><ul class='tnav'>
