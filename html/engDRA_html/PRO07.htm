Son,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Keep my commandments, and thou shalt live: and my law as the apple of thy eye:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Bind it upon thy fingers, write it upon the tables of thy heart.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Say to wisdom: Thou art my sister: and call prudence thy friend,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>That she may keep thee from the woman that is not thine, and from the stranger who sweeteneth her words.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For I look out of the window of my house through the lattice,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And I see little ones, I behold a foolish young man,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Who passeth through the street by the corner, and goeth nigh the way of her house.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>In the dark, when it grows late, in the darkness and obscurity of the night,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And behold a woman meeteth him in harlot’s attire prepared to deceive souls; talkative and wandering,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Not bearing to be quiet, not able to abide still at home,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Now abroad, now in the streets, now lying in wait near the corners.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And catching the young man, she kisseth him, and with an impudent face, flattereth, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I vowed victims for prosperity, this day I have paid my vows.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Therefore I am come out to meet thee, desirous to see thee, and I have found thee.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I have woven my bed with cords, I have covered it with painted tapestry, brought from Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Come, let us be inebriated with the breasts, and let us enjoy the desired embraces, till the day appear.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For my husband is not at home, he is gone a very long journey.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>He took with him a bag of money: he mill return home the day of the full moon.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>She entangled him with many words, and drew him away with the flattery of her lips.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Immediately he followeth her as an ox led to be a victim, and as a lamb playing the wanton, and not knowing that he is drawn like a fool to bonds,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Till the arrow pierce his liver: as if a bird should make haste to the snare, and knoweth not that his life is in danger.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Now therefore, my son, hear me, and attend to the words of my mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Let not thy mind be drawn away in her ways: neither be thou deceived with her paths.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For she hath cast down many wounded, and the strongest have been slain by her.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Her house is the way to hell, reaching even to the inner chambers of death. </div><ul class='tnav'>
