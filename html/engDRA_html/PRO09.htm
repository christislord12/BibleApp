And to the unwise she said:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Come, eat my bread, and drink the wine which I have mingled for you.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Forsake childishness, and live, and walk by the ways of prudence.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>He that teacheth a scorner, doth an injury to himself: and he that rebuketh a wicked man, getteth himself a blot.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Rebuke not a scorner lest he hate thee. Rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Give an occasion to a wise man, and wisdom shall be added to him. Teach a just man, and he shall make haste to receive it.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is prudence.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For by me shall thy days be multiplied, and years of life shall be added to thee.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>If thou be wise, thou shalt be so to thyself: and if a scorner, thou alone shalt bear the evil.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>A foolish woman and clamorous, and full of allurements, and knowing nothing at all,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Sat at the door of her house, upon a seat, in a high place of the city,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>To call them that pass by the way, and go on their journey:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He that is a little one, let him turn to me. And to the fool she said:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Stolen waters are sweeter, and hid den bread is more pleasant.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he did not know that giants are there, and that her guests are in the depths of hell. </div><ul class='tnav'>
