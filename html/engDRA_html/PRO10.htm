He that trusteth to lies feedeth the winds: and the same runneth after birds that fly away.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>He that gathered in the harvest is a wise son: but he that snorteth in the summer, is the son of confusion.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The blessing of the Lord is upon the head of the just: but iniquity covereth the mouth of the wicked.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The memory of the just is with praises: and the name of the wicked shall rot.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The wise of heart receiveth precepts: a fool is beaten with lips.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>He that walketh sincerely, walketh confidently: but he that perverteth his ways, shall be manifest.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He that winketh with the eye shall cause sorrow: and the foolish in lips shall be beaten.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The mouth of the just is a vein of life: and the mouth of the wicked covereth iniquity.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Hatred stirreth up strifes: and charity covereth all sins.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>In the lips of the wise is wisdom found: and a rod on the back of him that wanteth sense.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Wise men lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the fool is next to confusion.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The substance of a rich man is the city of his strength: the fear of the poor is their poverty.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The work of the just is unto life: but the fruit of the wicked, unto sin.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The way of life, to him that observeth correction: but he that forsaketh reproofs goeth astray.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Lying lips hide hatred: he that uttereth reproach is foolish.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>In the multitude of words there shall not want sin: but he that refraineth his lips is most wise.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The tongue of the just is as choice silver: but the heart of the wicked is nothing worth.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The lips of the just teach many: but they that are ignorant, shall die in the want of understanding.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The blessing of the Lord maketh men rich: neither shall affliction be joined to them.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>A fool worketh mischief as it were for sport: but wisdom is prudence to a man.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>That which the wicked feareth, shall come upon him: to the just their desire shall be given.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>As a tempest that passeth, so the wicked shall be no more: but the just is as an everlasting foundation.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>As vinegar to the teeth, and smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to them that sent him.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The fear of the Lord shall prolong days: and the years of the wicked shall be shortened.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>The expectation of the just is joy; but the hope of the wicked shall perish.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>The strength of the upright is the way of the Lord: and fear to them that work evil.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>The just shall never be moved: but the wicked shall not dwell on the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The mouth of the just shall bring forth wisdom: the tongue of the perverse shall perish.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>The lips of the just consider what is acceptable: and the mouth of the wicked uttereth perverse things. </div><ul class='tnav'>
