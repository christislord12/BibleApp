He that is delighted in passing his time over wine, leaveth a reproach in his strong holds.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The desire of the wicked is the fortification of evil men: but the root of the just shall prosper.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For the sins of the lips ruin draweth nigh to the evil mall: but the just shall escape out of distress.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>By the fruit of his own mouth shall a man be filled with good things, and according to the works of his hands it shall be repaid him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that is wise hearkeneth unto counsels.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>A fool immediately sheweth his anger: but he that dissembleth injuries is wise.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He that speaketh that which he knoweth, sheweth forth justice: but he that lieth, is a deceitful witness.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>There is that promiseth, and is pricked as it were with a sword of conscience: but the tongue of the wise is health.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The lip of truth shall be steadfast for ever: but he that is a hasty witness, frameth a lying tongue.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Deceit is in the heart of them that think evil things: but joy followeth them that take counsels of peace.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Whatsoever shall befall the just man. it shall not make him sad: but the wicked shall be filled with mischief.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord: but they that deal faithfully please him.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>A cautious man concealeth knowledge: and the heart of fools publisheth folly.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The hand of the valiant shall bear rule: but that which is slothful, shall be under tribute.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Grief in the heart of a man shall bring him low, but with a good word he shall be made glad.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>He that neglecteth a loss for the sake of a friend, is just: but the way of the wicked shall deceive them.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The deceitful man shall not find gain: but the substance of a just man shall be precious gold.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>In the path of justice is life: but the by-way leadeth to death. </div><ul class='tnav'>
