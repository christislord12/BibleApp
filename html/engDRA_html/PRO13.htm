Deceitful souls go astray in sins: the just are merciful, and shew mercy.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The law of the wise is a fountain of life, that he may decline from the ruin of death.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Good instruction shall give grace: in the way of scorners is a deep pit.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The prudent mall doth all things with counsel: but he that is a fool, layeth open his folly.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The messenger of the wicked shall fall into mischief: but a faithful ambassador is health.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Poverty and shame to him that refuseth instruction: but he that yieldeth to reproof, shall be glorified.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The desire that is accomplished, delighteth the soul: fools hate them that flee from evil things.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>He that walketh with the wise, shall be wise: a friend of fools shall become like to them.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Evil pursueth sinners: and to the just good shall be repaid.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The good man leaveth heirs, sons, and grandsons: and the substance of the sinner is kept for the just.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Much food is in the tillage of fathers: but for others it is gathered with out judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>He that spareth the rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him correcteth him betimes.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The just eateth and filleth his soul: but the belly of the wicked is never to be filled. </div><ul class='tnav'>
