No good shall come to the deceitful son: but the wise servant shall prosper in his dealings, and his way shall be made straight.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>A wise man feareth and declineth from evil: the fool leapeth over and is confident.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The impatient man shall work folly: and the crafty man is hateful.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The childish shall possess folly, and the prudent, shall look for knowledge.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The evil shall fall down before the good: and the wicked before the gates of the just.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The poor man shall be hateful even to his own neighbour: but the friends of the rich are many.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>He that despiseth his neighbour, sinneth: but he that sheweth mercy to the poor, shall be blessed. He that believeth in the Lord, loveth mercy.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>They err that work evil: but mercy and truth prepare good things.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>In much work there shall be abundance: but where there are many words, there is oftentimes want.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The crown of the wise is their riches: the folly of fools, imprudence.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>A faithful witness delivereth souls: and the double dealer uttereth lies.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>In the fear of the Lord is confidence of strength, and there shall be hope for his children.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life, to decline from the ruin of death.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>In the multitude of people is the dignity of the king: and in the small number of people the dishonour of the prince.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>He that is patient, is governed with much wisdom: but he that is impatient, exalteth his folly.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Soundness of heart is the life of the flesh: but envy is the rottenness of the bones.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>He that oppresseth the poor, upbraideth his Maker: but he that hath pity on the poor, honoureth him.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>The wicked man shall be driven out in his wickedness: but the just hath hope in his death.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>In the heart of the prudent resteth wisdom, and it shall instruct all the ignorant.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Justice exalteth a nation: but sin maketh nations miserable.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>A wise servant is acceptable to the king: he that is good for nothing shall feel his anger. </div><ul class='tnav'>
