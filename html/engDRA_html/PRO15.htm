In abundant justice there is the greatest strength: but the devices of the wicked shall be rooted out.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The house of the just is very much strength: and in the fruits of the wicked is trouble.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The lips of the wise shall disperse knowledge: the heart of fools shall be unlike.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The victims of the wicked are abominable to the Lord: the vows of the just are acceptable.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The way of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord: he that followeth justice is beloved by him.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Instruction is grievous to him that forsaketh the way of life: he that hateth reproof shall die.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Hell and destruction are before the Lord: how much more the hearts of the children of men?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>A corrupt man loveth not one that reproveth him: nor will he go to the wise.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>A glad heart maketh a cheerful countenance: but by grief of mind the spirit is cast down.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The heart of the wise seeketh instruction: and the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>All the days of the poor are evil: a secure mind is like a continual feast.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Better is a little with the fear of the Lord, than great treasures without content,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>It is better to be invited to herbs with love, than to a fatted calf with hatred.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>A passionate man stirreth up strifes: he that is patient appeaseth those that are stirred up.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The way of the slothful is as a hedge of thorns; the way of the just is without offence.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>A wise son maketh a father joyful: but the foolish man despiseth his mother.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Folly is joy to the fool: and the wise man maketh straight his steps.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Designs are brought to nothing where there is no counsel: but where there are many counsellors, they are established.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>A man rejoiceth in the sentence of his mouth: and a word in due time is best.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The path of life is above for the wise, that he may decline from the lowest hell.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The Lord will destroy the house of the proud: and will strengthen the borders of the widow.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Evil thoughts are an abomination to the Lord: and pure words most beautiful shall be confirmed by him.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house: but he that hateth bribes shall live. By mercy and faith sins are purged away: and by the fear of the Lord every one declineth from evil.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>The mind of the just studieth obedience: the mouth of the wicked over floweth with evils.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>The Lord is far from the wicked: and he will hear the prayers of the just.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>The light of the eyes rejoiceth the soul: a good name maketh the bones fat.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The ear that heareth the reproofs of life, shall abide in the midst of the wise.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>He that rejecteth instruction, despiseth his own soul: but he that yieldeth to reproof possesseth understanding.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>The fear of the Lord is the lesson of wisdom: and humility goeth before glory. </div><ul class='tnav'>
