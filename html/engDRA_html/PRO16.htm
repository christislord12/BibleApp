The beginning of a good way is to do justice; and this is more acceptable with God, than to offer sacrifices.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>By mercy and truth iniquity is redeemed: and by the fear of the Lord men depart from evil.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>When the ways of man shall please the Lord, he will convert even his enemies to peace.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Better is a little with justice, than great revenues with iniquity.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The heart of man disposeth his way: but the Lord must direct his steps.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Divination is in the lips of the king, his mouth shall not err in judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Weight and balance are judgments of the Lord: and his work all the weights of the bag.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>They that act wickedly are abominable to the king: for the throne is established by justice.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Just lips are the delight of kings: he that speaketh right things shall be loved.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The wrath of a king is as messengers of death: and the wise man will pacify it.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>In the cheerfulness of the king’s countenance is life: and his clemency is like the latter rain.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Get wisdom, because it is better than gold: and purchase prudence, for it is more precious than silver.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The path of the just departeth from evils: he that keepeth his soul keepeth his way.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Pride goeth before destruction: and the spirit is lifted up before a fall.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>It is better to be humbled with the meek, than to divide spoils with the proud.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The learned in word shall find good things: and he that trusteth in the Lord is blessed.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and he that is sweet in words shall attain to greater things.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Knowledge is a fountain of life to him that possesseth it: the instruction of fools is foolishness.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The heart of the wise shall instruct his mouth: and shall add grace to his lips.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Well ordered words are as a honeycomb: sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>There is a way that seemeth to a man right: and the ends thereof lead to death.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>The soul of him that laboureth, laboureth for himself, because his mouth hath obliged him to it.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The wicked man diggeth evil, and in his lips is a burning fire.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>A perverse man stirreth up quarrels: and one full of words separateth princes.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>An unjust man allureth his friend: and leadeth him into a way that is not good.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>He that with fixed eyes deviseth wicked things, biting his lips, bringeth: evil to pass.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Old age is a crown of dignity, when it is found in the ways of justice.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>The patient man is better than the valiant: and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh cities.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Lots are cast into the lap, but they are disposed of by the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
