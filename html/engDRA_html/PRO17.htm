He that maketh his house high, seeketh a downfall: and he that refuseth to learn, shall fall into evils.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He that is a friend loveth at all times: and a brother is proved in distress.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>A foolish man will clap hands, when he is surety for his friend.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>He that studieth discords, loveth quarrels: and he that exalteth his door, seeketh ruin.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>He that is of a perverse heart, shall not find good: and he that perverteth his tongue, shall fall into evil.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>A fool is born to his own disgrace: and even his father shall not rejoice in a fool.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>A joyful mind maketh age flourishing: a sorrowful spirit drieth up the bones.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The wicked man taketh gifts out of the bosom, that he may pervert the paths of judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Wisdom shineth in the face of the wise: the eyes of fools are in the ends of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>A foolish son is the anger of the father: and the sorrow of the mother that bore him.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>It is no good thing to do hurt to the just: nor to strike the prince, who judgeth right.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>He that setteth bounds to his words. is knowing and wise: and the man of understanding is of a precious spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Even a fool, if he will hold his peace shall be counted wise: and if he close his lips, a man of understanding. </div><ul class='tnav'>
