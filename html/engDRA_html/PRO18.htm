Fear casteth down the slothful: and the souls of the effeminate shall be hungry.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>He that is loose and slack in his work, is the brother of him that wasteth his own works.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The name of the Lord is a strong tower: the just runneth to it, and shall be exalted.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The substance of the rich man is the city of his strength, and as a strong wall compassing him about.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Before destruction, the heart of a man is exalted: and before he be glorified, it is humbled.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He that answereth before he heareth sheweth himself to be a fool, and worthy of confusion.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The spirit of a man upholdeth his infirmity: but a spirit that is easily angered, who can bear?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>A wise heart shall acquire knowledge: and the ear of the wise seeketh instruction.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>A man’s gift enlargeth his may, and maketh him room before princes.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The just is first accuser of himself: his friend cometh, and shall search him.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The lot suppresseth contentions, and determineth even between the mighty.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>A brother that is helped by his brother, is like a strong city: and judgments are like the bars of cities.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Of the fruit of a man’s mouth shall his belly be satisfied: and the offspring of his lips shall fill him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Death and life are in the power of the tongue: they that love it, shall eat the fruits thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>He that hath found a good wife, hath found a good thing, and shall receive a pleasure from the Lord. He that driveth away a good wife, driveth away a good thing: but he that keepeth an adulteress, is foolish and wicked.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The poor will speak with supplications, and the rich will speak roughly.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>A man amiable in society, shall be more friendly than a brother. </div><ul class='tnav'>
