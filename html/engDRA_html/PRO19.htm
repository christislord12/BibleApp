He that followeth after words only, shall have nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But he that possesseth a mind, loveth his own soul, and he that keepeth prudence shall find good things.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>A false witness shall not be unpunished: and he that speaketh lies, shall perish.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Delicacies are not seemly for a fool: nor for a servant to have rule over princes.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The learning of a man is known by patience and his glory is to pass over wrongs.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>As the roaring of a lion, so also is the anger of a king: and his cheerfulness as the dew upon the grass.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>A foolish son is the grief of his father: and a wrangling wife is like a roof continually dropping through.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>House and riches are given by parents: but a prudent wife is properly from the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep, and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He that keepeth the commandment, keepeth his own soul: but he that neglecteth his own way, shall die.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He that hath mercy on the poor, lendeth to the Lord: and he will repay him.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Chastise thy son, despair not: but to the killing of him set not thy soul.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>He that is impatient, shall suffer damage: and when he shall take away he shall add another thing.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayst be wise in thy latter end.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>There are many thoughts in the heart of a man: but the will of the Lord shall stand firm.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>A needy man is merciful: and better is the poor than the lying man.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The fear of the Lord is unto life: and he shall abide in fulness without being visited with evil.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The slothful hideth his hand under his armpit, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The wicked man being; scourged, the fool shall be wiser: but if thou rebuke a wise man he will understand discipline.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>He that afflicteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is infamous and unhappy.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Cease not, O my son, to hear instruction, and be not ignorant of the words of knowledge.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>An unjust witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Judgments are prepared for scorners: and striking hammers for the bodies of fools. </div><ul class='tnav'>
