He that maketh presents shall purchase victory and honour: but he carrieth away the souls of the receivers.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Cast out the scoffer, and contention shall go out with him, and quarrels and reproaches shall cease.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>He that loveth cleanness of heart, for the grace of his lips shall have the king for his friend.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The eyes of the Lord preserve knowledge: and the words of the unjust are overthrown.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The slothful man saith: There is a lion without, I shall be slain in the midst of the streets.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The mouth of a strange woman is a deep pit: he whom the Lord is angry with, shall fall into it.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Folly is bound up in the heart of a child, and the rod of correction shall drive it away.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He that oppresseth the poor, to increase his own riches, shall himself give to one that is richer, and shall be in need.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Incline thy ear, and hear the words of the wise: and apply thy heart to my doctrine:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Which shall be beautiful for thee, if thou keep it in thy bowels, and it shall flow in thy lips:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>That thy trust may be in the Lord, wherefore I have also shewn it to thee this day.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Behold I have described it to thee three manner of ways, in thoughts and knowledge:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>That I might shew thee the certainty, and the words of truth, to answer out of these to them that sent thee.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Do no violence to the poor, because he is poor: and do not oppress the needy in the gate:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Because the Lord will judge his cause, and will afflict them that have afflicted his soul.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Be not a friend to an angry man, and do not walk with a furious man:  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Lest perhaps thou learn his ways, and take scandal to thy soul.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Be not with them that fasten down their hands, and that offer themselves sureties for debts:  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For if thou have not wherewith to restore, what cause is there, that he should take the covering from thy bed?  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Pass not beyond the ancient bounds which thy fathers have set.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Hast thou seen a man swift in his work? he shall stand before kings, and shall not be before those that are obscure. </div><ul class='tnav'>
