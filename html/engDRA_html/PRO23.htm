Eat and drink, will he say to thee: and his mind is not with thee.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The meats which thou hadst eaten, thou shalt vomit up: and shalt loose thy beautiful words.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Speak not in the ears of fools: because they will despise the instruction of thy speech.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Touch not the bounds of little ones: and enter not into the field of the fatherless:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For their near kinsman is strong: and he will judge their cause against thee.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Let thy heart apply itself to instruction: and thy ears to words of knowledge.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Withhold not correction from a child: for if thou strike him with the rod, he shall not die.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and deliver his soul from hell.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>My son, if thy mind be wise, my heart shall rejoice with thee:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips shall speak what is right.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Let not thy heart envy sinners: but be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day long:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Because thou shalt have hope in the latter end, and thy expectation shall not be taken away.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Hear thou, my son, and be wise: and guide thy mind in the way.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Be not in the feasts of great drinkers, nor in their revellings, who contribute flesh to eat:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Because they that give themselves to drinking, and that club together shall be consumed; and drowsiness shall be clothed with rags.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Hearken to thy father, that beget thee: and despise not thy mother when she is old.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Buy truth, and do not sell wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The father of the just rejoiceth greatly: he that hath begotten a wise son, shall have joy in him.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Let thy father, and thy mother be joyful, and let her rejoice that bore thee.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>My son, give me thy heart: and let thy eyes keep my ways.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For a harlot is a deep ditch: and a strange woman is a narrow pit.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>She lieth in wait in the way as a robber, and him whom she shall see unwary, she will kill.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Who hath woe? whose father hath woe? who hath contentions? who falls into pits? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Surely they that pass their time in wine, and study to drink of their cups.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Look not upon the wine when it is yellow, when the colour thereof shineth in the glass: it goeth in pleasantly,  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But in the end, it will bite like a snake, and will spread abroad poison like a basilisk.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Thy eyes shall behold strange women, and thy heart shall utter perverse things.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And thou shalt be as one sleeping in the midst of the sea, and as a pilot fast asleep, when the stern is lost.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And thou shalt say: They have beaten me, but I was not sensible of pain: they drew me, and I felt not: when shall I awake, and find wine again? </div><ul class='tnav'>
