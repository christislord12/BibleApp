<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 25</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>These are also parables of Solomon, which the men of Ezechias king of Juda copied out.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>It is the glory of God to conceal the word, and the glory of kings to search out the speech.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The heaven above, and the earth beneath, and the heart of kings is unsearchable.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Take away the rust from silver, and there shall come forth a most pure vessel:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Take away wickedness from the face of the king, and his throne shall be established with justice.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Appear not glorious before the king, and stand not in the place of great men.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For it is better that it should be said to thee: Come up hither; than that thou shouldst be humbled before the prince.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The things which thy eyes have seen, utter not hastily in a quarrel: lest afterward thou mayst not be able to make amends, when thou hast dishonoured thy friend.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Treat thy cause with thy friend, and discover not the secret to a stranger:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Lest he insult over thee, when he hath heard it, and cease not to upbraid thee. Grace and friendship deliver a man: keep these for thyself, lest thou fall under reproach.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>To speak a word in due time, is like apples of gold on beds of silver.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>As an earring of gold and a bright pearl, so is he that reproveth the wise, and the obedient ear.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to him that sent him, for he refresheth his soul.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>As clouds, and wind, when no rain followeth, so is the man that boasteth, and doth not fulfill his promises.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>By patience a prince shall be appeased, and a soft tongue shall break hardness.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Thou hast found honey, eat what is sufficient for thee, lest being glutted therewith thou vomit it up.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Withdraw thy foot from the house of thy neighbour, lest having his fill he hate thee.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour, is like a dart and a sword and a sharp arrow.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>To trust to an unfaithful man in the time of trouble, is like a rotten tooth, and weary foot,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And one that looseth his garment in cold weather. As vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to a very evil heart. As a moth doth by a garment, and a worm by the wood: so the sadness of a man consumeth the heart.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>If thy enemy be hungry, give him to eat: if he thirst, give him water to drink:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For thou shalt heap hot coals upon his head, and the Lord will reward thee.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The north wind driveth away rain, as doth a sad countenance a backbiting tongue.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>It is better to sit in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman, and in a common house.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>As cold water to a thirsty soul, so is good tidings from a far country.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>A just man falling down before the wicked, is as a fountain troubled with the foot, and a corrupted spring.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>As it is not good for a man to eat much honey, so he that is a searcher of majesty, shall be overwhelmed by glory.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>As a city that lieth open and is not compassed with walls, so is a man that cannot refrain his own spirit in speaking. </div><ul class='tnav'>
