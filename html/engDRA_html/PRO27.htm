<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 27</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Boast not for tomorrow, for thou knowest not what the day to come may bring forth.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Let another praise thee, and not thy own mouth: a stranger, and not thy own lips.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>A stone is heavy, and sand weighty: but the anger of a fool is heavier than them both.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Anger hath no mercy, nor fury when it breaketh forth: and who can bear the violence of one provoked?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Open rebuke is better than hidden love.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Better are the wounds of a friend, than the deceitful kisses of an enemy.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>A soul that is full shall tread upon the honeycomb: and a soul that is hungry shall take even bitter for sweet.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that leaveth his place.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Ointment and perfumes rejoice the heart: and the good counsels of a friend are sweet to the soul.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Thy own friend, and thy father’s friend forsake not: and go not into thy brother’s house in the day of thy affliction. Better is a neighbour that is near, than a brother afar off.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Study wisdom, my son, and make my heart joyful, that thou mayst give an answer to him that reproacheth.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The prudent man seeing evil hideth himself: little ones passing on have suffered losses.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Take away his garment that hath been surety for a stranger: and take from him a pledge for strangers.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He that blesseth his neighbour with a loud voice, rising in the night, shall be like to him that curseth.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Roofs dropping through in a cold day, and a contentious woman are alike.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He that retaineth her, is as he that would hold the wind, and shall call in the oil of his right hand.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Iron sharpeneth iron, so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>He that keepeth the fig tree, shall eat the fruit thereof: and he that is the keeper of his master, shall be glorified.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>As the faces of them that look therein, shine in the water, so-the hearts of men are laid open to the wise.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Hell and destruction are never filled: so the eyes of men are never satisfied.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>As silver is tried in the fining-pot and gold in the furnace: so a man is tried by the mouth of him that praiseth. The heart of the wicked seeketh after evils, but the righteous heart seeketh after knowledge.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Though thou shouldst bray a fool in the mortar, as when a pestle striketh upon sodden barley, his folly would not be taken from him.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Be diligent to know the countenance of thy cattle, and consider thy own flocks:  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For thou shalt not always have power: but a crown shall be given to generation and generation.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The meadows are open, and the green herbs have appeared, and the hay is gathered out of the mountains.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Lambs are for thy clothing: and kids for the price of the field.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Let the milk of the goats be enough for thy food, and for the necessities of thy house, and for maintenance for thy handmaids. </div><ul class='tnav'>
