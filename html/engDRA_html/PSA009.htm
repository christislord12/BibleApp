A psalm for David. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I will give praise to thee, O Lord, with my whole heart: I will relate all thy wonders. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing to thy name, O thou most high. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>When my enemy shall be turned back: they shall be weakened and perish before thy face. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For thou hast maintained my judgment and my cause: thou hast sat on the throne, who judgest justice. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Thou hast rebuked the Gentiles, and the wicked one hath perished: thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The swords of the enemy have failed unto the end: and their cities thou hast destroyed. Their memory hath perished with a noise. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But the Lord remaineth for ever. He hath prepared his throne in judgment: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he shall judge the world in equity, he shall judge the people in justice. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the Lord is become a refuge for the poor: a helper in due time in tribulation. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And let them trust in thee who know thy name: for thou hast not forsaken them that seek thee, O Lord. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Sing ye to the Lord, who dwelleth in Sion: declare his ways among the Gentiles: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For requiring their blood he hath remembered the: he hath not forgotten the cry of the poor. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Have mercy on me, O Lord: see my humiliation which I suffer from my enemies. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Thou that liftest me up from the gates of death, that I may declare all thy praises in the gates of the daughter of Sion. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I will rejoice in thy salvation: the Gentiles have stuck fast in the destruction which they have prepared.
