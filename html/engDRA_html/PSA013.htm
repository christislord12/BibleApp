The fool hath said in his heart: There is no God, They are corrupt, and are become abominable in their ways: there is none that doth good, no not one. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The Lord hath looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there be any that understand and seek God. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>They are all gone aside, they are become unprofitable together: there is none that doth good, no not one. Their throat is an open sepulchre: with their tongues they acted deceitfully; the poison of asps is under their lips. Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness; their feet are swift to shed blood. Destruction and unhappiness in their ways: and the way of peace they have not known: there is no fear of God before their eyes. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Shall not all they know that work iniquity, who devour my people as they eat bread? </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>They have not called upon the Lord: there have they trembled for fear, where there was no fear. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For the Lord is in the just generation: you have confounded the counsel of the poor man, but the Lord is his hope. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Who shall give out of Sion the salvation of Israel? when the Lord shall have turned away the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice and Israel shall be glad. </div><ul class='tnav'>
