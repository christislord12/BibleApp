Far from my salvation are the words of my sins. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>O my God, I shall cry by day, and thou wilt not hear: and by night, and it shall not be reputed as folly in me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But thou dwellest in the holy place, the praise of Israel. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>In thee have our fathers hoped: they have hoped, and thou hast delivered them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>They cried to thee, and they were saved: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But I am a worm, and no man: the reproach of men, and the outcast of the people. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>All they that saw me have laughed me to scorn: they have spoken with the lips, and wagged the head. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>He hoped in the Lord, let him deliver him: let him save him, seeing he delighteth in him. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For thou art he that hast drawn me out of the womb: my hope from the breasts of my mother. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I was cast upon thee from the womb.
