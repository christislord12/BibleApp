<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 26</div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>The psalm of David before he was anointed. The Lord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear? The Lord is the protector of my life: of whom shall I be afraid? </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Whilst the wicked draw near against me, to eat my flesh. My enemies that trouble me, have themselves been weakened, and have fallen. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>If armies in camp should stand together against me, my heart shall not fear. If a battle should rise up against me, in this will I be confident. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>One thing I have asked of the Lord, this will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life. That I may see the delight of the Lord, and may visit his temple. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For he hath hidden me in his tabernacle; in the day of evils, he hath protected me in the secret place of his tabernacle. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>He hath exalted me upon a rock: and now he hath lifted up my head above my enemies. I have gone round, and have offered up in his tabernacle a sacrifice of jubilation: I will sing, and recite a psalm to the Lord. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Hear, O Lord, my voice, with which I have cried to thee: have mercy on me and hear me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>My heart hath said to thee: My face hath sought thee: thy face, O Lord, will I still seek. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Turn not away thy face from me; decline not in thy wrath from thy servant. Be thou my helper, forsake me not; do not thou despise me, O God my Saviour. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For my father and my mother have left me: but the Lord hath taken me up. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Set me, O Lord, a law in thy way, and guide me in the right path, because of my enemies. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Deliver me not over to the will of them that trouble me; for unjust witnesses have risen up against me; and iniquity hath lied to itself. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I believe to see the good things of the Lord in the land of the living. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Expect the Lord, do manfully, and let thy heart take courage, and wait thou for the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
