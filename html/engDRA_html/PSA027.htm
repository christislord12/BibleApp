According to the works of their hands give thou to them: render to them their reward. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Because they have not understood the works of the Lord, and the operations of his hands: thou shalt destroy them, and shalt not build them up. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Blessed be the Lord, for he hath heard the voice of my supplication. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The Lord is my helper and my protector: in him hath my heart confided, and I have been helped.
