<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 30</div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Unto the end, a psalm for David, in an ecstasy. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>In thee, O Lord, have I hoped, let me never be confounded: deliver me in thy justice. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Bow down thy ear to me: make haste to deliver me. Be thou unto me a God, a protector, and a house of refuge, to save me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For thou art my strength and my refuge; and for thy name’s sake thou wilt lead me, and nourish me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Thou wilt bring me out of this snare, which they have hidden for me: for thou art my protector. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Into thy hands I commend my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O Lord, the God of truth. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Thou hast hated them that regard vanities, to no purpose. But I have hoped in the Lord: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy. For thou best regarded my humility, thou hast saved my soul out of distresses. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And thou hast not shut me up in the hands of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a spacious place. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am afflicted: my eye is troubled with wrath, my soul, and my belly: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For my life is wasted with grief: and my years in sighs. My strength is weakened through poverty and my bones are disturbed. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I am become a reproach among all my enemies, and very much to my neighbours; and a fear to my acquaintance. They that saw me without fled from me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I am forgotten as one dead from the heart. I am become as a vessel that is destroyed. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For I have heard the blame of many that dwell round about. While they assembled together against me, they consulted to take away my life. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But I have put my trust in thee, O Lord: I said: Thou art my God. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>My lots are in thy hands. Deliver me out of the hands of my enemies; and from them that persecute me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; save me in thy mercy. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Let me not be confounded, O Lord, for I have called upon thee. Let the wicked be ashamed, and be brought down to hell. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Let deceitful lips be made dumb. Which speak iniquity against the just, with pride and abuse. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>O how great is the multitude of thy sweetness, O Lord, which thou hast hidden for them that fear thee! Which thou hast wrought for them that hope in thee, in the sight of the sons of men. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy face, from the disturbance of men. Thou shalt protect them in thy tabernacle from the contradiction of tongues. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Blessed be the Lord, for he hath shewn his wonderful mercy to me in a fortified city. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But I said in the excess of my mind: I am cast away from before thy eyes. Therefore thou hast heard the voice of my prayer, when I cried to thee. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>O love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord will require truth, and will repay them abundantly that act proudly. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Do ye manfully, and let your heart be strengthened, all ye that hope in the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
