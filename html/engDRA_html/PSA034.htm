Judge thou, O Lord, them that wrong me: overthrow them that fight against me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Take hold of arms and shield: and rise up to help me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Bring out the sword, and shut up the way against them that persecute me: say to my soul: I am thy salvation. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Let them be confounded and ashamed that seek after my soul. Let them be turned back and be confounded that devise against me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Let them become as dust before the wind: and let the angel of the Lord straiten them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Let their way become dark and slippery; and let the angel of the Lord pursue them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For without cause they have hidden their net for me unto destruction: without cause they have upbraided my soul. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Let the snare which he knoweth not come upon him: and let the net which he hath hidden catch him: and let the net which he hath hidden catch him: and into that very snare let them fall. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But my soul shall rejoice in the Lord; and shall be delighted in his salvation. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>All my bones shall say: Lord, who is like to thee?
