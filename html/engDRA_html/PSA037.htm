And they that were near me stood afar off: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And they that sought my soul used violence. And they that sought evils to me spoke vain things, and studied deceits all the day long. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But I, as a deaf man, heard not: and as a dumb man not opening his mouth. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And I became as a man that heareth not: and that hath no reproofs in his mouth. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For in thee, O Lord, have I hoped: thou wilt hear me, O Lord my God. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For I said: Lest at any time my enemies rejoice over me: and whilst my feet are moved, they speak great things against me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For I am ready for scourges: and my sorrow is continually before me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For I will declare my inequity: and I will think for my sin. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But my enemies live, and are stronger that I: and they hate me wrongfully are multiplied. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>They that render evil for good, have detracted me, because I followed goodness. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Forsake me not, O Lord my God: do not thou depart from me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Attend unto my help, O Lord, the God of my salvation. </div><ul class='tnav'>
