I have set guard to my mouth, when the sinner stood against me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I was dumb, and was humbled, and kept silence from good things: and my sorrow was renewed. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>My heart grew hot within me: and in my meditation a fire shall flame out. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>I spoke with my tongue: O Lord, make me know my end. And what is the number of my days: that I may know what is wanting to me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Behold thou hast made my days measurable: and my substance is as nothing before thee. And indeed all things are vanity: every man living. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Surely man passeth as an image: yea, and he is disquieted in vain. He storeth up: and he knoweth not for whom he shall gather these things. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And now what is my hope? is it not the Lord? and my substance is with thee. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Deliver thou me from all my iniquities: thou hast made me a reproach to the fool. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I was dumb, and I opened not my mouth, because thou hast done it. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Remove thy scourges from me. The strength of thy hand hath made me faint in rebukes: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Thou hast corrected man for iniquity. And thou hast made his soul to waste away like a spider: surely in vain is any man disquieted. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Hear my prayer, O Lord, and my supplication: give ear to my tears. Be not silent: for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner as all my fathers were. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>O forgive me, that I may be refreshed, before I go hence, and be no more. </div><ul class='tnav'>
