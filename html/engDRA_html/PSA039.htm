<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 39</div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Unto the end, a psalm for David himself. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>With expectation I have waited for the Lord, and he was attentive to me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And he heard my prayers, and brought me out of the pit of misery and the mire of dregs. And he set my feet upon a rock, and directed my steps. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And he put a new canticle into my mouth, a song to our God. Many shall see, and shall fear: and they shall hope in the Lord. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Blessed is the man whose trust is in the name of the Lord; and who hath not had regard to vanities, and lying follies. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Thou hast multiplied thy wonderful works, O Lord my God: and in thy thoughts there is no one like to thee. I have declared and I have spoken they are multiplied above number. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Sacrifice and oblation thou didst not desire; but thou hast pierced ears for me. Burnt offering and sin offering thou didst not require: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then said I, Behold I come. In the head of the book it is written of me </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>That I should do thy will: O my God, I have desired it, and thy law in the midst of my heart. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I have declared thy justice in a great church, lo, I will not restrain my lips: O Lord, thou knowest it. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I have not hid thy justice within my heart: I have declared thy truth and thy salvation. I have not concealed thy mercy and thy truth from a great council. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Withhold not thou, O Lord, thy tender mercies from me: thy mercy and thy truth have always upheld me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For evils without number have surrounded me; my iniquities have overtaken me, and I was not able to see. They are multiplied above the hairs of my head: and my heart hath forsaken me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me, look down, O Lord, to help me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Let them be confounded and ashamed together, that seek after my soul to take it away. Let them be turned backward and be ashamed that desire evils to me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Let them immediately bear their confusion, that say to me: Tis well, tis well. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Let all that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say always: The Lord be magnified. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But I am a beggar and poor: the Lord is careful for me. Thou art my helper and my protector: O my God, be not slack. </div><ul class='tnav'>
