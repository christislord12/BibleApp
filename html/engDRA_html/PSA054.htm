I am grieved in my exercise; and am troubled, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>At the voice of the enemy, and at the tribulation of the sinner. For they have cast iniquities upon me: and in wrath they were troublesome to me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>My heart is troubled within me: and the fear of death is fallen upon me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Fear and trembling are come upon me: and darkness hath covered me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And I said: Who will give me wings like a dove, and I will fly and be at rest? </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Lo, I have gone far off flying away; and I abode in the wilderness. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I waited for him that hath saved me from pusillanimity of spirit, and a storm. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Cast down, O Lord, and divide their tongues; for I have seen iniquity and contradiction in the city. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Day and night shall iniquity surround it upon its walls: and in the midst thereof are labour, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And injustice. And usury and deceit have not departed from its streets. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For if my enemy had reviled me, I would verily have borne with it. And if he that hated me had spoken great things against me, I would perhaps have hidden myself from him. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But thou a man of one mind, my guide, and my familiar, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Who didst take sweetmeats together with me: in the house of God we walked with consent. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Let death come upon them, and let them go down alive into hell. For there is wickedness in their dwellings: in the midst of them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But I have cried to God: and the Lord will save me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Evening and morning, and at noon I will speak and declare: and he shall hear my voice. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>He shall redeem my soul in peace from them that draw near to me: for among many they were with me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>God shall hear, and the Eternal shall humble them. For there is no change with them, and they have not feared God: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>He hath stretched forth his hand to repay. They have defiled his covenant, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>They are divided by the wrath Of his countenance, and his heart hath drawn near. His words are smoother than oil, and the same are darts. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Cast thy care upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee: he shall not suffer the just to waver for ever. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction. Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee, O Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
