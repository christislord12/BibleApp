<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 68</div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Unto the end, for them that shall be changed; for David. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>SAVE me, O God: for the waters are come in even unto my soul. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I stick fast in the mire of the deep: and there is no sure standing. I am come into the depth of the sea: and a tempest hath overwhelmed me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I have laboured with crying; my jaws are become hoarse: my eyes have failed, whilst I hope in my God. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>They are multiplied above the hairs of my head, who hate me without cause. My enemies are grown strong who have wrongfully persecuted me: then did I pay that which I took not away. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my offences are not hidden from thee: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Let not them be ashamed for me, who look for thee, O Lord, the Lord of hosts. Let them not be confounded on my account, who seek thee, O God of Israel. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I am become a stranger to my brethren, and an alien to the sons of my mother. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up: and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And I covered my soul in fasting: and it was made a reproach to me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And I made haircloth my garment: and I became a byword to them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>They that sat in the gate spoke against me: and they that drank wine made me their song. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But as for me, my prayer is to thee, O Lord; for the time of thy good pleasure, O God. In the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Draw me out of the mire, that I may not stick fast: deliver me from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Let not the tempest of water drown me, nor the deep swallow me up: and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Hear me, O Lord, for thy mercy is kind; look upon me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And turn not away thy face from thy servant: for I am in trouble, hear me speedily. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Attend to my soul, and deliver it: save me because of my enemies. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Thou knowest my reproach, and my confusion, and my shame. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>In thy sight are all they that afflict me; my heart hath expected reproach and misery. And I looked for one that would grieve together with me, but there was none: and for one that would comfort me, and I found none. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And they gave me gall for my food, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Let their table become as a snare before them, and a recompense, and a stumblingblock. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Let their eyes be darkened that they see not; and their back bend thou down always. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Pour out thy indignation upon them: and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Let their habitation be made desolate: and let there be none to dwell in their tabernacles. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Because they have persecuted him whom thou hast smitten; and they have added to the grief of my wounds. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Add thou iniquity upon their iniquity: and let them not come into thy justice. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Let them be blotted out of the book of the living; and with the just let them not be written. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But I am poor and sorrowful: thy salvation, O God, hath set me up. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>I will praise the name of God with a canticle: and I will magnify him with praise. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And it shall please God better than a young calf, that bringeth forth horns and hoofs. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Let the poor see and rejoice: seek ye God, and your soul shall live. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>For the Lord hath heard the poor: and hath not despised his prisoners. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Let the heavens and the earth praise him; the sea, and every thing that creepeth therein. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>For God will save Sion, and the cities of Juda shall be built up. And they shall dwell there, and acquire it by inheritance. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And the seed of his servants shall possess it; and they that love his name shall dwell therein. </div><ul class='tnav'>
