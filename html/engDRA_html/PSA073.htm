O God, why hast thou cast us off unto the end: why is thy wrath enkindled against the sheep of thy pasture? </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Remember thy congregation, which thou hast possessed from the beginning. The sceptre of thy inheritance which thou hast redeemed: mount Sion in which thou hast dwelt. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Lift up thy hands against their pride unto the end; see what things the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And they that hate thee have made their boasts, in the midst of thy solemnity. They have set up their ensigns for signs, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And they knew not both in the going out and on the highest top. As with axes in a wood of trees, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>They have cut down at once the gates thereof, with axe and hatchet they have brought it down. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>They have set fire to thy sanctuary: they have defiled the dwelling place of thy name on the earth. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>They said in their heart, the whole kindred of them together: Let us abolish all the festival days of God from the land. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Our signs we have not seen, there is now no prophet: and he will know us no more. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>How long, O God, shall the enemy reproach: is the adversary to provoke thy name for ever? </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Why dost thou turn away thy hand: and thy right hand out of the midst of thy bosom for ever? </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But God is our king before ages: he hath wrought salvation in the midst of the earth. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Thou by thy strength didst make the sea firm: thou didst crush the heads of the dragons in the waters. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Thou hast broken the heads of the dragon: thou hast given him to be meat for the people of the Ethiopians. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Thou hast broken up the fountains and the torrents: thou hast dried up the Ethan rivers. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Thine is the day, and thine is the night: thou hast made the morning light and the sun. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Thou hast made all the borders of the earth: the summer and the spring were formed by thee. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Remember this, the enemy hath reproached the Lord: and a foolish people hath provoked thy name. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Deliver not up to beasts the souls that confess to thee: and forget not to the end the souls of thy poor. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Have regard to thy covenant: for they that are the obscure of the earth have been filled with dwellings of iniquity. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Let not the humble be turned away with confusion: the poor and needy shall praise thy name. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Arise, O God, judge thy own cause: remember thy reproaches with which the foolish man hath reproached thee all the day. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Forget not the voices of thy enemies: the pride of them that hate thee ascendeth continually. </div><ul class='tnav'>
