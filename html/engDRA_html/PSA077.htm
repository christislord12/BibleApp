<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 77</div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Understanding for Asaph. Attend, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I will open my mouth in parables: I will utter propositions from the beginning. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>How great things have we heard and known, and our fathers have told us. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>They have not been hidden from their children, in another generation. Declaring the praises of the Lord, and his powers, and his wonders which he hath done. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And he set up a testimony in Jacob: and made a law in Israel. How great things he commanded our fathers, that they should make the same known to their children: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>That another generation might know them. The children that should be born and should rise up, and declare them to their children. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>That they may put their hope in God and may not forget the works of God: and may seek his commandments. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>That they may not become like their fathers, a perverse and exasperating generation. A generation that set not their heart aright: and whose spirit was not faithful to God. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The sons of Ephraim who bend and shoot with the bow: they have turned back in the day of battle. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They kept not the covenant of God: and in his law they would not walk. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And they forgot his benefits, and his wonders that he had shewn them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Wonderful things did he do in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Tanis. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He divided the sea and brought them through: and he made the waters to stand as in a vessel. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he conducted them with a cloud by day: and all the night with a light of fire. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He struck the rock in the wilderness: and gave them to drink, as out of the great deep. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He brought forth water out of the rock: and made streams run down as rivers. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And they added yet more sin against him: they provoked the most High to wrath in the place without water. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And they tempted God in their hearts, by asking meat for their desires. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And they spoke ill of God: they said: Can God furnish a table in the wilderness? </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Because he struck the rock, and the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed. Can he also give bread, or provide a table for his people? </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Therefore the Lord heard, and was angry: and a fire was kindled against Jacob, and wrath came up against Israel. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Because they believed not in God: and trusted not in his salvation. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he had commanded the clouds from above, and had opened the doors of heaven. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them the bread of heaven. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Man ate the bread of angels: he sent them provisions in abundance. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>He removed the south wind from heaven: and by his power brought in the southwest wind. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And he rained upon them flesh as dust: and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And they fell in the midst of their camp, round about their pavilions. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>So they did eat, and were filled exceedingly, and he gave them their desire: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>They were not defrauded of that which they craved. As yet their meat was in their mouth: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And the wrath of God came upon them. And he slew the fat ones amongst them, and brought down the chosen men of Israel. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>In all these things they sinned still: and they believed not for his wondrous works. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And their days were consumed in vanity, and their years in haste. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned, and came to him early in the morning. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And they remembered that God was their helper: and the most high God their redeemer. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And they loved him with their mouth: and with their tongue they lied unto him: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>But their heart was not right with him: nor were they counted faithful in his covenant. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>But he is merciful, and will forgive their sins: and will not destroy them. And many a time did he turn away his anger: and did not kindle all his wrath. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And he remembered that they are flesh: a wind that goeth and returneth not. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>How often did they provoke him in the desert: and move him to wrath in the place without water? </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And they turned back and tempted God: and grieved the holy one of Israel. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>They remembered not his hand, in the day that he redeemed them from the hand of him that afflicted them: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>How he wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Tanis. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And he turned their rivers into blood, and their showers that they might, not drink. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>He sent amongst them divers sores of flies, which devoured them: and frogs which destroyed them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And he gave up their fruits to the blast, and their labours to the locust. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And he destroyed their vineyards with hail, and their mulberry trees with hoarfrost. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>And he gave up their cattle to the hail, and their stock to the fire. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>And he sent upon them the wrath of his indignation: indignation and wrath and trouble, which he sent by evil angels. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>He made a way for a path to his anger: he spared not their souls from death, and their cattle he shut up in death. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>And he killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt: the firstfruits of all their labour in the tabernacles of Cham. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>And he took away his own people as sheep: and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>And he brought them out in hope, and they feared not: band the sea overwhelmed their enemies. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>And he brought them into the mountain of his sanctuary: the mountain which his right hand had purchased. And he cast out the Gentiles before them: and by lot divided to them their land by a line of distribution. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>And he made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tabernacles. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>Yet they tempted, and provoked the most high God: and they kept not his testimonies. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>And they turned away, and kept not the covenant: even like their fathers they were turned aside as a crooked bow. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>They provoked him to anger on their hills: and moved him to jealousy with their graven things. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>God heard, and despised them, and he reduced Israel exceedingly as it were to nothing. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>And he put away the tabernacle of Silo, his tabernacle where he dwelt among men. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>And he delivered their strength into captivity: and their beauty into the hands of the enemy. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>And he shut up his people under the sword: and he despised his inheritance. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>Fire consumed their young men: and their maidens were not lamented. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#160;</span>Their priests fell by the sword: and their widows did not mourn. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V65">65&#160;</span>And the Lord was awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that hath been surfeited with wine. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V66">66&#160;</span>And he smote his enemies on the hinder parts: he put them to an everlasting reproach. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V67">67&#160;</span>And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph: and chose not the tribe of Ephraim: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V68">68&#160;</span>But he chose the tribe of Juda, mount Sion which he loved. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V69">69&#160;</span>And he built his sanctuary as of unicorns, in the land which he founded for ever. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V70">70&#160;</span>And he chose his servant David, and took him from the hocks of sheep: he brought him from following the ewes great with young, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V71">71&#160;</span>To feed Jacob his servant, and Israel his inheritance. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V72">72&#160;</span>And he fed them in the innocence of his heart: and conducted them by the skillfulness of his hands. </div><ul class='tnav'>
