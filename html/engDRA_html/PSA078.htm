O God, the heathens are come into thy inheritance, they have defiled thy holy temple: they have made Jerusalem as a place to keep fruit. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>They have given the dead bodies of thy servants to be meat for the fowls of the air: the flesh of thy saints for the beasts of the earth. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>They have poured out their blood as water, round about Jerusalem and there was none to bury them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>We are become a reproach to our neighbours: a scorn and derision to them that are round about us. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>How long, O Lord, wilt thou be angry for ever: shall thy zeal be kindled like a fire? </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that have not known thee: and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Because they have devoured Jacob; and have laid waste his place. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Remember not our former iniquities: let thy mercies speedily prevent us, for we are become exceeding poor. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Help us, O God, our saviour: and for the glory of thy name, O Lord, deliver us: and forgive us our sins for thy name’s sake: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Lest they should say among the Gentiles: Where is their God? And let him be made known among the nations before our eyes, By the revenging the blood of thy servants, which hath been shed: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Let the sighing of the prisoners come in before thee.
