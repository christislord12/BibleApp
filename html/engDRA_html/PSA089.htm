Lord, thou hast been our refuge from generation to generation. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Before the mountains were made, or the earth and the world was formed; from eternity and to eternity thou art God. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Turn not man away to be brought low: and thou hast said: Be converted, O ye sons of men. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For a thousand years in thy sight are as yesterday, which is past. And as a watch in the night, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Things that are counted nothing, shall their years be. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>In the morning man shall grow up like grass; in the morning he shall flourish and pass away: in the evening he shall fall, grow dry, and wither. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For in thy wrath we have fainted away: and are troubled in thy indignation. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Thou hast set our iniquities before thy eyes: our life in the light of thy countenance. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For all our days are spent; and in thy wrath we have fainted away. Our years shall be considered as a spider: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The days of our years in them are threescore and ten years. But if in the strong they be fourscore years: and what is more of them is labour and sorrow. For mildness is come upon us: and we shall be corrected. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Who knoweth the power of thy anger, and for thy fear </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Can number thy wrath? So make thy right hand known: and men learned in heart, in wisdom. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Return, O Lord, how long? and be entreated in favour of thy servants. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>We are filled in the morning with thy mercy: and we have rejoiced, and are delighted all our days. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>We have rejoiced for the days in which thou hast humbled us: for the years in which we have seen evils. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Look upon thy servants and upon their works: and direct their children. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us: and direct thou the works of our hands over us; yea, the work of our hands do thou direct. </div><ul class='tnav'>
