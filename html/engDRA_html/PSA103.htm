Thou hast put on praise and beauty: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And art clothed with light as with a garment. Who stretchest out the heaven like a pavilion: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Who coverest the higher rooms thereof with water. Who makest the clouds thy chariot: who walkest upon the wings of the winds. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Who makest thy angels spirits: and thy ministers a burning fire. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Who hast founded the earth upon its own bases: it shall not be moved for ever and ever. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The deep like a garment is its clothing: above the mountains shall the waters stand. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>At thy rebuke they shall flee: at the voice of thy thunder they shall fear. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The mountains ascend, and the plains descend into the place which thou hast founded for them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Thou hast set a bound which they shall not pass over; neither shall they return to cover the earth. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Thou sendest forth springs in the vales: between the midst of the hills the waters shall pass. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>All the beasts of the field shall drink: the wild asses shall expect in their thirst. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Over them the birds of the air shall dwell: from the midst of the rocks they shall give forth their voices. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Thou waterest the hills from thy upper rooms: the earth shall be filled with the fruit of thy works: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Bringing forth grass for cattle, and herb for the service of men. That thou mayst bring bread out of the earth: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And that wine may cheer the heart of man. That he may make the face cheerful with oil: and that bread may strengthen man’s heart. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The trees of the field shall be filled, and the cedars of Libanus which he hath planted: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>There the sparrows shall make their nests.
