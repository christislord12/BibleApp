Or else I come to thee, and will move thy candlestick out of its place, except thou do penance.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaites, which I also hate.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>He, that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches: To him, that overcometh, I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of my God.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And to the angel of the church of Smyrna write: These things saith the First and the Last, who was dead, and is alive:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I know thy tribulation and thy poverty, but thou art rich: and thou art blasphemed by them that say they are Jews and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer. Behold, the devil will cast some of you into prison that you may be tried: and you shall have tribulation ten days. Be thou faithful until death: and I will give thee the crown of life.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>He, that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches: He that shall overcome, shall not be hurt by the second death.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And to the angel of the church of Pergamus write: These things, saith he, that hath the sharp two edged sword:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I know where thou dwellest, where the seat of Satan is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith. Even in those days when Antipas was my faithful witness, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But I have against thee a few things: because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat, and to commit fornication:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaites.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>In like manner do penance: if not, I will come to thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He, that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches: To him that overcometh, I will give the hidden manna, and will give him a white counter, and in the counter, a new name written, which no man knoweth, but he that receiveth it.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And to the angel of the church of Thyatira write: These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like to a flame of fire, and his feet like to fine brass.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>I know thy works, and thy faith, and thy charity, and thy ministry, and thy patience, and thy last works which are more than the former.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But I have against thee a few things: because thou sufferest the woman Jezabel, who calleth herself a prophetess, to teach, and to seduce my servants, to commit fornication, and to eat of things sacrificed to idols.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And I gave her a time that she might do penance, and she will not repent of her fornication.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Behold, I will cast her into a bed: and they that commit adultery with her shall be in very great tribulation, except they do penance from their deeds.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And I will kill her children with death, and all the churches shall know that I am he that searcheth the reins and hearts, and I will give to every one of you according to your works. But to you I say,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And to the rest who are at Thyatira: Whosoever have not this doctrine, and who have not known the depths of Satan, as they say, I will not put upon you any other burthen.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Yet that, which you have, hold fast till I come.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And he that shall overcome, and keep my works unto the end, I will give him power over the nations.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And he shall rule them with a rod of iron, and as the vessel of a potter they shall be broken,  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>As I also have received of my Father: and I will give him the morning star.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. </div><ul class='tnav'>
