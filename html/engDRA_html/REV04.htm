And they rested not day and night, saying: Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And when those living creatures gave glory, and honour, and benediction to him that sitteth on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The four and twenty ancients fell down before him that sitteth on the throne, and adored him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Thou art worthy, O Lord our God, to receive glory, and honour, and power: because thou hast created all things; and for thy will they were, and have been created. </div><ul class='tnav'>
