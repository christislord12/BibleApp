Benediction, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, honour, and power, and strength to our God for ever and ever. Amen.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And one of the ancients answered, and said to me: These that are clothed in white robes, who are they? and whence came they?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And I said to him: My Lord, thou knowest. And he said to me: These are they who are come out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and have made them white in the blood of the Lamb.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Therefore they are before the throne of God, and they serve him day and night in his temple: and he, that sitteth on the throne, shall dwell over them.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>They shall no more hunger nor thirst, neither shall the sun fall on them, nor any heat.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For the Lamb, which is in the midst of the throne, shall rule them, and shall lead them to the fountains of the waters of life, and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes. </div><ul class='tnav'>
