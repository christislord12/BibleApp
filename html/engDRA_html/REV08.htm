And the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the fourth angel sounded the trumpet, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars, so that the third part of them was darkened, and the day did not shine for a third part of it, and the night in like manner.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And I beheld, and heard the voice of one eagle flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice: Woe, woe, woe to the inhabitants of the earth: by reason of the rest of the voices of the three angels, who are yet to sound the trumpet. </div><ul class='tnav'>
