Woe to the earth, and to the sea, because the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, knowing that he hath but a short time.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman, who brought forth the man child:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And there were given to the woman two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the desert unto her place, where she is nourished for a time and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the serpent cast out of his mouth after the woman, water as it were a river; that he might cause her to be carried away by the river.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the river, which the dragon cast out of his mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the dragon was angry against the woman: and went to make war with the rest of her seed, who keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he stood upon the sand of the sea. </div><ul class='tnav'>
