For in them is filled up the wrath of God.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire, and them that had overcome the beast, and his image, and the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, having the harps of God:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And singing the canticle of Moses, the servant of God, and the canticle of the Lamb, saying: Great and wonderful are thy works, O Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, O King of ages.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and magnify thy name? For thou only art holy: for all nations shall come, and shall adore in thy sight, because thy judgments are manifest.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And after these things I looked; and behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed with clean and white linen, and girt about the breasts with golden girdles.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden vials, full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the temple was filled with smoke from the majesty of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled. </div><ul class='tnav'>
