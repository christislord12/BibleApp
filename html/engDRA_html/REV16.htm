Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And he shall gather them together into a place, which in Hebrew is called Armagedon.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the seventh angel poured out his vial upon the air, and there came a great voice out of the temple from the throne, saying: It is done.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and there was a great earthquake, such an one as never had been since men were upon the earth, such an earthquake, so great.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the great city was divided into three parts; and the cities of the Gentiles fell. And great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give her the cup of the wine of the indignation of his wrath.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And great hail, like a talent, came down from heaven upon men: and men blasphemed God for the plague of the hail: because it was exceeding great. </div><ul class='tnav'>
