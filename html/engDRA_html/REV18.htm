 <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And they cast dust upon their heads, and cried, weeping and mourning, saying: Alas! alas! that great city, wherein all were made rich, that had ships at sea, by reason of her prices: for in one hour she is made desolate.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath judged your judgment on her.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And a mighty angel took up a stone, as it were a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying: With such violence as this shall Babylon, that great city, be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the voice of harpers, and of musicians, and of them that play on the pipe, and on the trumpet, shall no more be heard at all in thee; and no craftsman of any art whatsoever shall be found any more at all in thee; and the sound of the mill shall be heard no more at all in thee;  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the light of the lamp shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth, for all nations have been deceived by thy enchantments.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth. </div><ul class='tnav'>
