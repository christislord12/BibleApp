And the Lord God of the spirits of the prophets sent his angel to shew his servants the things which must be done shortly.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And, Behold I come quickly. Blessed is he that keepeth the words of the prophecy of this book.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And I, John, who have heard and seen these things. And after I had heard and seen, I fell down to adore before the feet of the angel, who shewed me these things.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he said to me: See thou do it not: for I am thy fellow servant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them that keep the words of the prophecy of this book. Adore God.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And he saith to me: Seal not the words of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>He that hurteth, let him hurt still: and he that is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is just, let him be justified still: and he that is holy, let him be sanctified still.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to render to every man according to his works.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Blessed are they that wash their robes in the blood of the Lamb: that they may have a right to the tree of life, and may enter in by the gates into the city.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Without are dogs, and sorcerers, and unchaste, and murderers, and servers of idols, and every one that loveth and maketh a lie.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I Jesus have sent my angel, to testify to you these things in the churches. I am the root and stock of David, the bright and morning star.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the spirit and the bride say: Come. And he that heareth, let him say: Come. And he that thirsteth, let him come: and he that will, let him take the water of life, freely.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For I testify to every one that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book: If any man shall add to these things, God shall add unto him the plagues written in this book.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from these things that are written in this book.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>He that giveth testimony of these things, saith, Surely I come quickly: Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen. </div><ul class='tnav'>
