For wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself. For thou dost the same things which thou judgest.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>For we know that the judgment of God is, according to truth, against them that do such things.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them who do such things, and dost the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and patience, and longsuffering? Knowest thou not, that the benignity of God leadeth thee to penance?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But according to thy hardness and impenitent heart, thou treasurest up to thyself wrath, against the day of wrath, and revelation of the just judgment of God.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Who will render to every man according to his works.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>To them indeed, who according to patience in good work, seek glory and honour and incorruption, eternal life:  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But to them that are contentious, and who obey not the truth, but give credit to iniquity, wrath and indignation.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that worketh evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But glory, and honour, and peace to every one that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For there is no respect of persons with God.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For whosoever have sinned without the law, shall perish without the law; and whosoever have sinned in the law, shall be judged by the law.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For when the Gentiles, who have not the law, do by nature those things that are of the law; these having not the law are a law to themselves:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Who shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness to them, and their thoughts between themselves accusing, or also defending one another,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my gospel.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But if thou art called a Jew and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And knowest his will, and approvest the more profitable things, being instructed by the law,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them that are in darkness,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, having the form of knowledge and of truth in the law.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Thou therefore that teachest another, teachest not thyself: thou that preachest that men should not steal, stealest:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Thou that sayest, men should not commit adultery, committest adultery: thou that abhorrest idols, committest sacrilege:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Thou that makest thy boast of the law, by transgression of the law dishonourest God.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>(For the name of God through you is blasphemed among the Gentiles, as it is written.)  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Circumcision profiteth indeed, if thou keep the law; but if thou be a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>If, then, the uncircumcised keep the justices of the law, shall not this uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And shall not that which by nature is uncircumcision, if it fulfill the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision art a transgressor of the law?  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For it is not he is a Jew, who is so outwardly; nor is that circumcision which is outwardly in the flesh:  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>But he is a Jew, that is one inwardly; and the circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
