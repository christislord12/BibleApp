<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 3</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>What advantage then hath the Jew, or what is the profit of circumcision?  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Much every way. First indeed, because the words of God were committed to them.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For what if some of them have not believed? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect? God forbid.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But God is true; and every man a liar, as it is written, That thou mayest be justified in thy words, and mayest overcome when thou art judged.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But if our injustice commend the justice of God, what shall we say? Is God unjust, who executeth wrath?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>(I speak according to man.) God forbid: otherwise how shall God judge this world?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie, unto his glory, why am I also yet judged as a sinner?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And not rather (as we are slandered, and as some affirm that we say) let us do evil, that there may come good? whose damnation is just.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>What then? Do we excel them? No, not so. For we have charged both Jews, and Greeks, that they are all under sin.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>As it is written: There is not any man just.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>All have turned out of the way; they are become unprofitable together: there is none that doth good, there is not so much as one.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have dealt deceitfully. The venom of asps is under their lips.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Their feet swift to shed blood:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Destruction and misery in their ways:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the way of peace they have not known:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>There is no fear of God before their eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Now we know, that what things soever the law speaketh, it speaketh to them that are in the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may be made subject to God.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before him. For by the law is the knowledge of sin.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But now without the law the justice of God is made manifest, being witnessed by the law and the prophets.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Even the justice of God, by faith of Jesus Christ, unto all and upon all them that believe in him: for there is no distinction:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For all have sinned, and do need the glory of God.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption, that is in Christ Jesus,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Whom God hath proposed to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to the shewing of his justice, for the remission of former sins,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Through the forbearance of God, for the shewing of his justice in this time; that he himself may be just, and the justifier of him, who is of the faith of Jesus Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Where is then thy boasting? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but by the law of faith.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For we account a man to be justified by faith, without the works of the law.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For it is one God, that justifieth circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Do we, then, destroy the law through faith? God forbid: but we establish the law. </div><ul class='tnav'>
