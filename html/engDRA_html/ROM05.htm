For if by the offence of one, many died; much more the grace of God, and the gift, by the grace of one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And not as it was by one sin, so also is the gift. For judgment indeed was by one unto condemnation; but grace is of many offences, unto justification.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For if by one man’s offence death reigned through one; much more they who receive abundance of grace, and of the gift, and of justice, shall reign in life through one, Jesus Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Therefore, as by the offence of one, unto all men to condemnation; so also by the justice of one, unto all men to justification of life.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For as by the disobedience of one man, many were made sinners; so also by the obedience of one, many shall be made just.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Now the law entered in, that sin might abound. And where sin abounded, grace did more abound.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>That as sin hath reigned to death; so also grace might reign by justice unto life everlasting, through Jesus Christ our Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
