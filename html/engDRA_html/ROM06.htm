For we that are dead to sin, how shall we live any longer therein?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Know you not that all we, who are baptized in Christ Jesus, are baptized in his death?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For we are buried together with him by baptism into death; that as Christ is risen from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also may walk in newness of life.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin may be destroyed, to the end that we may serve sin no longer.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For he that is dead is justified from sin.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall live also together with Christ:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Knowing that Christ rising again from the dead, dieth now no more, death shall no more have dominion over him.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For in that he died to sin, he died once; but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>So do you also reckon, that you are dead to sin, but alive unto God, in Christ Jesus our Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Let no sin therefore reign in your mortal body, so as to obey the lusts thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Neither yield ye your members as instruments of iniquity unto sin; but present yourselves to God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of justice unto God.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For sin shall not have dominion over you; for you are not under the law, but under grace.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>What then? Shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Know you not, that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants you are whom you obey, whether it be of sin unto death, or of obedience unto justice.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But thanks be to God, that you were the servants of sin, but have obeyed from the heart, unto that form of doctrine, into which you have been delivered.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Being then freed from sin, we have been made servants of justice.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>I speak an human thing, because of the infirmity of your flesh. For as you have yielded your members to serve uncleanness and iniquity, unto iniquity; so now yield your members to serve justice, unto sanctification.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For when you were the servants of sin, you were free men to justice.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>What fruit therefore had you then in those things, of which you are now ashamed? For the end of them is death.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, you have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end life everlasting.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For the wages of sin is death. But the grace of God, life everlasting, in Christ Jesus our Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
