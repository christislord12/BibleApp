<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 9</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>I speak the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost:  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>That I have great sadness, and continual sorrow in my heart.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For I wished myself to be an anathema from Christ, for my brethren, who are my kinsmen according to the flesh,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Who are Israelites, to whom belongeth the adoption as of children, and the glory, and the testament, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Whose are the fathers, and of whom is Christ, according to the flesh, who is over all things, God blessed for ever. Amen.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Not as though the word of God hath miscarried. For all are not Israelites that are of Israel:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Neither are all they that are the seed of Abraham, children; but in Isaac shall thy seed be called:  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>That is to say, not they that are the children of the flesh, are the children of God; buy they, that are the children of the promise, are accounted for the seed.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For this is the word of promise: According to this time will I come; and Sara shall have a son.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And not only she. But when Rebecca also had conceived at once, of Isaac our father.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For when the children were not yet born, nor had done any good or evil (that the purpose of God, according to election, might stand,)  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Not of works, but of him that calleth, it was said to her: The elder shall serve the younger.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>As it is written: Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>What shall we say then? Is there injustice with God? God forbid.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For he saith to Moses: I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy; and I will shew mercy to whom I will shew mercy.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For the scripture saith to Pharao: To this purpose have I raised thee, that I may shew my power in thee, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Therefore he hath mercy on whom he will; and whom he will, he hardeneth.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Thou wilt say therefore to me: Why doth he then find fault? for who resisteth his will?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it: Why hast thou made me thus?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Or hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump, to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath, fitted for destruction,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>That he might shew the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he hath prepared unto glory?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Even us, whom also he hath called, nor only of the Jews, but also of the Gentiles.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>As in Osee he saith: I will call that which was not my people, my people; and her that was not beloved, beloved; and her that had not obtained mercy, one that hath obtained mercy.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And it shall be, in the place where it was said unto them, You are not my people; there they shall be called the sons of the living God.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Isaias crieth out concerning Israel: If the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For he shall finish his word, and cut it short in justice; because a short word shall the Lord make upon the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And as Isaias foretold: Unless the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been made as Sodom, and we had been like unto Gomorrha.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who followed not after justice, have attained to justice, even the justice that is of faith.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>But Israel, by following after the law of justice, is not come unto the law of justice.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Why so? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were of works. For they stumbled at the stumblingstone.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>As it is written: Behold I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and a rock of scandal; and whosoever believeth in him shall not be confounded. </div><ul class='tnav'>
