Hating that which is evil, cleaving to that which is good.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Loving one another with the charity of brotherhood, with honour preventing one another.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>In carefulness not slothful. In spirit fervent. Serving the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Rejoicing in hope. Patient in tribulation. Instant in prayer.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Communicating to the necessities of the saints. Pursuing hospitality.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Bless them that persecute you: bless, and curse not.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Rejoice with them that rejoice; weep with them that weep.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Being of one mind one towards another. Not minding high things, but consenting to the humble. Be not wise in your own conceits.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>To no man rendering evil for evil. Providing good things, not only in the sight of God, but also in the sight of all men.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>If it be possible, as much as is in you, have peace with all men.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Revenge not yourselves, my dearly beloved; but give place unto wrath, for it is written: Revenge is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But if thy enemy be hungry, give him to eat; if he thirst, give him to drink. For, doing this, thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil by good. </div><ul class='tnav'>
