<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 13</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Let every soul be subject to higher powers: for there is no power but from God: and those that are, are ordained of God.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Therefore he that resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God. And they that resist, purchase to themselves damnation.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For princes are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good: and thou shalt have praise from the same.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For he is God’s minister to thee, for good. But if thou do that which is evil, fear: for he beareth not the sword in vain. For he is God’s minister: an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Wherefore be subject of necessity, not only for wrath, but also for conscience’ sake.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For therefore also you pay tribute. For they are the ministers of God, serving unto this purpose.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Render therefore to all men their dues. Tribute, to whom tribute is due: custom, to whom custom: fear, to whom fear: honour, to whom honour.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Owe no man any thing, but to love one another. For he that loveth his neighbour, hath fulfilled the law.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For Thou shalt not commit adultery: Thou shalt not kill: Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness: Thou shalt not covet: and if there be any other commandment, it is comprised in this word, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The love of our neighbour worketh no evil. Love therefore is the fulfilling of the law.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And that knowing the season; that it is now the hour for us to rise from sleep. For now our salvation is nearer than when we believed.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The night is passed, and the day is at hand. Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and put on the armour of light.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Let us walk honestly, as in the day: not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and impurities, not in contention and envy:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh in its concupiscences. </div><ul class='tnav'>
