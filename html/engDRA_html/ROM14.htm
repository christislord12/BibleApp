<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 14</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Now him that is weak in faith, take unto you: not in disputes about thoughts.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>For one believeth that he may eat all things: but he that is weak, let him eat herbs.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Let not him that eateth, despise him that eateth not: and he that eateth not, let him not judge him that eateth. For God hath taken him to him.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant? To his own lord he standeth or falleth. And he shall stand: for God is able to make him stand.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For one judgeth between day and day: and another judgeth every day: let every man abound in his own sense.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord. And he that eateth, eateth to the Lord: for he giveth thanks to God. And he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth thanks to God.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For none of us liveth to himself; and no man dieth to himself.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; or whether we die, we die unto the Lord. Therefore, whether we live, or whether we die, we are the Lord’s.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For to this end Christ died and rose again; that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But thou, why judgest thou thy brother? or thou, why dost thou despise thy brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For it is written: As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Therefore every one of us shall render account to God for himself.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Let us not therefore judge one another any more. But judge this rather, that you put not a stumblingblock or a scandal in your brother’s way.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I know, and am confident in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself; but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For if, because of thy meat, thy brother be grieved, thou walkest not now according to charity. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Let not then our good be evil spoken of.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but justice, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For he that in this serveth Christ, pleaseth God, and is approved of men.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Therefore let us follow after the things that are of peace; and keep the things that are of edification one towards another.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Destroy not the work of God for meat. All things indeed are clean: but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>It is good not to eat flesh, and not to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother is offended, or scandalized, or made weak.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Hast thou faith? Have it to thyself before God. Blessed is he that condemneth not himself in that which he alloweth.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But he that discerneth, if he eat, is condemned; because not of faith. For all that is not of faith is sin. </div><ul class='tnav'>
