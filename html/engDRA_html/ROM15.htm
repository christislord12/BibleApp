For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they ought also in carnal things to minister to them.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>When therefore I shall have accomplished this, and consigned to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And I know, that when I come to you, I shall come in the abundance of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>I beseech you therefore, brethren, through our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the charity of the Holy Ghost, that you help me in your prayers for me to God,  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>That I may be delivered from the unbelievers that are in Judea, and that the oblation of my service may be acceptable in Jerusalem to the saints.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>That I may come to you with joy, by the will of God, and may be refreshed with you.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen. </div><ul class='tnav'>
