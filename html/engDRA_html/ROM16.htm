For she also hath assisted many, and myself also.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Salute Prisca and Aquila, my helpers in Christ Jesus,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>(Who have for my life laid down their own necks: to whom not I only give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles,)  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the church which is in their house. Salute Epenetus, my beloved: who is the firstfruits of Asia in Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Salute Mary, who hath laboured much among you.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Salute Andronicus and Junias, my kinsmen and fellow prisoners: who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Salute Ampliatus, most beloved to me in the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Salute Urbanus, our helper in Christ Jesus, and Stachys, my beloved.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Salute Apelles, approved in Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Salute them that are of Aristobulus’ household. Salute Herodian, my kinsman. Salute them that are of Narcissus’ household, who are in the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Salute Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute Persis, the dearly beloved, who hath much laboured in the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Salute Rufus, elect in the Lord, and his mother and mine.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren that are with them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Salute Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympias; and all the saints that are with them.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Salute one another with an holy kiss. All the churches of Christ salute you.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Now I beseech you, brethren, to mark them who make dissensions and offences contrary to the doctrine which you have learned, and avoid them.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For they that are such, serve not Christ our Lord, but their own belly; and by pleasing speeches and good words, seduce the hearts of the innocent.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For your obedience is published in every place. I rejoice therefore in you. But I would have you to be wise in good, and simple in evil.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the God of peace crush Satan under your feet speedily. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Timothy, my fellow labourer, saluteth you, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Caius, my host, and the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus, the treasurer of the city, saluteth you, and Quartus, a brother.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Now to him that is able to establish you, according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret from eternity,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>(Which now is made manifest by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the precept of the eternal God, for the obedience of faith,) known among all nations;  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>To God the only wise, through Jesus Christ, to whom be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen. </div><ul class='tnav'>
