And she answered: I am Ruth thy handmaid: spread thy coverlet over thy servant, for thou art a near kinsman.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And he said: Blessed art thou of the Lord, my daughter, and thy latter kindness has surpassed the former: because thou hast not followed young men either poor or rich.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Fear not therefore, but whatsoever thou shalt say to me I will do to thee. For all the people that dwell within the gates of my city, know that thou art a virtuous woman.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Neither do I deny myself to be near of kin, but there is another nearer than I.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Rest thou this night: and when morning is come, if he will take thee by the right of kindred, all is well: but if he will not, I will undoubtedly take thee, as the Lord liveth: sleep till the morning.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So she slept at his feet till the night was going off. And she arose before men could know one another, and Booz said: Beware lest any man know that thou camest hither.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And again he said: Spread thy mantle, wherewith thou art covered, and hold it with both hands. And when she spread it and held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it upon her. And she carried it and went into the city,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And came to her mother in law; who said to her: What hast thou done, daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And she said: Behold he hath given me six measures of barley: for he said: I will not have thee return empty to thy mother in law.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Noemi said: Wait my daughter, till we see what end the thing will have. For the man will not rest until he have accomplished what he hath said. </div><ul class='tnav'>
