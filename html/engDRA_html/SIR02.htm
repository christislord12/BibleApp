Keep his fear, and grow old therein.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Ye that fear the Lord, wait for his mercy: and go not aside from him, lest ye fall.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Ye that fear the Lord, believe him: and your reward shall not be made void.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Ye that fear the Lord, hope in him: and mercy shall come to you for your delight.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Ye that fear the Lord, love him, and your hearts shall be enlightened.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>My children behold the generations of men: and know ye that no one hath hoped in the Lord, and hath been confounded.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For who hath continued in his commandment, and hath been forsaken? or who hath called upon him, and he despised him?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For God is compassionate and merciful, and will forgive sins in the day of tribulation: and he is a protector to all that seek him in truth.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Woe to them that are of a double heart and to wicked lips, and to the hands that do evil, and to the sinner that goeth on the earth two ways.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Woe to them that are fainthearted, who believe not God: and therefore they shall not be protected by him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Woe to them that have lost patience, and that have forsaken the right ways, and have gone aside into crooked ways.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And what will they do, when the Lord shall begin to examine?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>They that fear the Lord, will not be incredulous to his word: and they that love him, will keep his way.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>They that fear the Lord, will seek after the things that are well pleasing to him: and they that love him, shall be filled with his law.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>They that fear the Lord, will prepare their hearts, and in his sight will sanctify their souls.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>They that fear the Lord, keep his Commandments, and will have patience even until his visitation,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Saying: If we do not penance, we shall fall into the hands of the Lord, and not into the hands of men.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For according to his greatness, so also is his mercy with him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
