 <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And if his understanding fail, have patience with him, and despise him not when thou art in thy strength: for the relieving of the father shall not be forgotten.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For good shall be repaid to thee for the sin of thy mother.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And in justice thou shalt be built up, and in the day of affliction thou shalt be remembered: and thy sins shall melt away as the ice in the fair warm weather.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Of what an evil fame is he that forsaketh his father: and he is cursed of God that angereth his mother.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>My son, do thy works in meekness, and thou shalt be beloved above the glory of men.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The greater thou art, the more humble thyself in all things, and thou shalt find grace before God:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For great is the power of God alone, and he is honoured by the humble.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Seek not the things that are too high for thee, and search not into things above thy ability: but the things that God hath commanded thee, think on them always, and in many of his works be not curious.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For it is not necessary for thee to see with thy eyes those things that are hid.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>In unnecessary matters be not over curious, and in many of his works thou shalt not be inquisitive.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For many things are shewn to thee above the understanding of men.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the suspicion of them hath deceived many, and hath detained their minds in vanity.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>A hard heart shall fear evil at the last: and he that loveth danger shall perish in it.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>A heart that goeth two ways shall not have success, and the perverse of heart shall be scandalized therein.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>A wicked heart shall be laden with sorrows, and the sinner will add sin to sin.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>The congregation of the proud shall not be healed: for the plant of wickedness shall take root in them, and it shall not be perceived.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The heart of the wise is understood in wisdom, and a good ear will hear wisdom with all desire.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>A wise heart, and which hath understanding, will abstain from sins, and in the works of justice shall have success.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Water quencheth a flaming fire, and alms resisteth sins:  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And God provideth for him that sheweth favour: he remembereth him afterwards, and in the time of his fall he shall find a sure stay. </div><ul class='tnav'>
