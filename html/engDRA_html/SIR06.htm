and there is a friend that will disclose hatred and strife and reproaches.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And there is a friend a companion at the table, and he will not abide in the day of distress.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>A friend if he continue steadfast, shall be to thee as thyself, and shall act with confidence among them of thy household.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>If he humble himself before thee, and hide himself from thy face, thou shalt have unanimous friendship for good.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Separate thyself from thy enemies, and take heed of thy friends.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>A faithful friend is a strong defence: and he that hath found him, hath found a treasure.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Nothing can be compared to a faithful friend, and no weight of gold and silver is able to countervail the goodness of his fidelity.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>A faithful friend is the medicine of life and immortality: and they that fear the Lord, shall find him.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He that feareth God, shall likewise have good friendship: because according to him shall his friend be.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>My son, from thy youth up receive instruction, and even to thy grey hairs thou shalt find wisdom.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Come to her as one that plougheth, and soweth, and wait for her good fruits:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For in working about her thou shalt labour a little, and shalt quickly eat of her fruits.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>How very unpleasant is wisdom to the unlearned, and the unwise will not continue with her.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>She shall be to them as a mighty stone of trial, and they will cast her from them before it be long.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For the wisdom of doctrine is according to her name, and she is not manifest unto many, but with them to whom she is known, she continueth even to the sight of God.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Give ear, my son, and take wise counsel, and cast not away my advice.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Put thy feet into her fetters, and thy neck into her chains:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Bow down thy shoulder, and bear her, and be not grieved with her bands.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Come to her with all thy mind, and keep her ways with all thy power.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Search for her, and she shall be made known to thee, and when thou hast gotten her, let her not go:  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For in the latter end thou shalt find rest in her, and she shall be turned to thy joy.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Then shall her fetters be a strong defence for thee, and a firm foundation, and her chain a robe of glory:  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For in her is the beauty of life, and her bands are a healthful binding.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Thou shalt put her on as a robe of glory, and thee shalt set her upon thee as a crown of joy.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>My son, if thou wilt attend to me, thou shalt learn: and if thou wilt apply thy mind, thou shalt be wise.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>If thou wilt incline thy ear, thou shalt receive instruction: and if thou love to hear, thou shalt be wise.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Stand in the multitude of ancients that are wise, and join thyself from thy heart to their wisdom, that thou mayst hear every discourse of God, and the sayings of praise may not escape thee.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And if thou see a man of understanding, go to him early in the morning, and let thy foot wear the steps of his doors.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Let thy thoughts be upon the precepts of God, and meditate continually on his commandments: and he will give thee a heart, and the desire of wisdom shall be given thee. </div><ul class='tnav'>
