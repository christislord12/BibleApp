Why is earth and ashes proud?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>There is not a more wicked thing than to love money: for such a one setteth even his own soul to sale: because while he liveth he hath cast away his bowels.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>All power is of short life. A long sickness is troublesome to the physician.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The physician cutteth off it short sickness: so also a king is today, and tomorrow he shall die.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For when a man shall die, he shall inherit serpents, and beasts, and worms.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The beginning of the pride of man, is to fall off from God:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Because his heart is departed from him that made him: for pride is the beginning of all sin: be that holdeth it, shall be filled with maledictions, and it shall ruin him in the end.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Therefore hath the Lord disgraced the assemblies of the wicked, and hath utterly destroyed them.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>God hath overturned the thrones of proud princes, and hath set up the meek in their stead.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>God hath made the roots of proud nations to wither, and hath planted the humble of these nations.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The Lord hath overthrown the lands of the Gentiles, and hath destroyed them even to the foundation.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>He hath made some of them to wither away, and hath destroyed them, and hath made the memory of them to cease from the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>God hath abolished the memory of the proud, and hath preserved the memory of them that are humble in mind.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Pride was not made for men: nor wrath for the race of women.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>That seed of men shall be honoured, which feareth God: but that seed shall be dishonoured, which transgresseth the commandments of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>In the midst of brethren their chief is honourable: so shall they that fear the Lord, be in his eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The fear of God is the glory of the rich, and of the honourable, and of the poor:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Despise not a just man that is poor, and do not magnify a sinful man that is rich.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The great man, and the judge, and the mighty is in honour: and there is none greater than he that feareth God.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>They that are free shall serve a servant that is wise: and a man that is prudent and well instructed will not murmur when he is reproved; and he that is ignorant, shall not be honoured.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Extol not thyself in doing thy work, and linger not in the time of distress:  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Better is he that laboureth, and aboundeth in all things, than he that boasteth himself and wanteth bread.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>My son, keep thy soul in meekness, and give it honour according to its desert.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Who will justify him that sinneth against his own soul? and who will honour him that dishonoureth his own soul?  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>The poor man is glorified by his discipline and fear: and there is a man that is honoured for his wealth.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But he that is glorified in poverty, how much more in wealth? and he that is glorified in wealth, let him fear poverty. </div><ul class='tnav'>
