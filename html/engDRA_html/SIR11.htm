Love and the ways of good things are with him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Error and darkness are created with sinners: and they that glory in evil things, grow old in evil.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The gift of God abideth with the just, and his advancement shall have success for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>There is one that is enriched by living sparingly, and this is the portion of his reward.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>In that he saith: I have found me rest, and now I will eat of my goods alone:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he knoweth not what time shall pass, and that death approacheth, and that he must leave all to others, and shall die.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Be steadfast in thy covenant, and be conversant therein, and grow old in the work of thy commandments.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Abide not in the works of sinners. But trust in God, and stay in thy place.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For it is easy in the eyes of God on a sudden to make the poor man rich.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The blessing of God maketh haste to reward the just, and in a swift hour his blessing beareth fruit.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Say not: What need I, and what good shall I have by this?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Say not: I am sufficient for myself: and what shall I be made worse by this?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>In the day of good things be not unmindful of evils: and in the day of evils be not unmindful of good things:  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For it is easy before God in the day of death to reward every one according to his ways.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>The affliction of an hour maketh one forget great delights, and in the end of a man is the disclosing of his works.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Praise not any man before death, for a man is known by his children.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Bring not every man into thy house: for many are the snares of the deceitful.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>For as corrupted bowels send forth stinking breath, and as the partridge is brought into the cage, and as the roe into the snare: so also is the heart of the proud, and as a spy that looketh on the fall of his neighbour.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>For he lieth in wait and turneth good into evil, and on the elect he will lay a blot.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Of one spark cometh a great fire, and of one deceitful man much blood: and a sinful man lieth in wait for blood.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Take heed to thyself of a mischievous man, for he worketh evils: lest he bring upon thee reproach for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Receive a stranger in, and he shall overthrow thee with a whirlwind, and shall turn thee out of thy own. </div><ul class='tnav'>
