And have no fellowship with one that is richer than thyself.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>What agreement shall the earthen pot have with the kettle? for if they knock one against the other, it shall be broken.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The rich man hath done wrong, and yet he will fume: but the poor is wronged and must hold his peace.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>If thou give, he will make use of thee: and if thou have nothing, he will forsake thee.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>If thou have any thing, he will live with thee, and will make thee bare, and he will not be sorry for thee.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>If he have need of thee he will deceive thee, and smiling upon thee will put thee in hope; he will speak thee fair, and will say: What wantest thou?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And he will shame thee by his meats, till he have drawn thee dry twice or thrice, and at last he will laugh at thee: and afterward when he seeth thee, he will forsake thee, and shake his head at thee.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Humble thyself to God, and wait for his hands.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Beware that thou be not deceived Into folly, and be humbled.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Be not lowly in thy wisdom, lest being humbled thou be deceived into folly.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>If thou be invited by one that is mightier, withdraw thyself: for so he will invite thee the more.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Be not troublesome to him, lest thou be put back: and keep not far from him, lest thou be forgotten.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Affect not to speak with him as an equal: and believe not his many words: for by much talk he will sift thee, and smiling will examine thee concerning thy secrets.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>His cruel mind will lay up thy words: and he will not spare to do thee hurt, and to cast thee into prison.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Take heed to thyself, and attend diligently to what thou hearest: for thou walkest in danger of thy ruin.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>When thou hearest those things, see as it were in sleep, and thou shalt awake.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Love God all thy life, and call upon him for thy salvation.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Every beast loveth its like: so also every man him that is nearest to himself.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>All flesh shall consort with the like to itself, and every man shall associate himself to his like.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>If the wolf shall at any time have fellowship with the lamb, so the sinner with the just.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>What fellowship hath a holy man with a dog, or what part hath the rich with the poor?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The wild ass is the lion’s prey in the desert: so also the poor are devoured by the rich.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And as humility is an abomination to the proud: so also the rich man abhorreth the poor.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>When a rich man is shaken, he is kept up by his friends: but when a poor man is fallen down, he is thrust away even by his acquaintance.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>When a rich man hath been deceived, he hath many helpers: he hath spoken proud things, and they have justified him.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The poor man was deceived, and he is rebuked also: he hath spoken wisely, and could have no place.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>The rich man spoke, and all held their peace, and what he said they extol even to the clouds.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>The poor man spoke, and they say: Who is this? and if he stumble, they will overthrow him.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Riches are good to him that hath no sin in his conscience: and poverty is very wicked in the mouth of the ungodly.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The heart of a man changeth his countenance, either for good, or for evil.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>The token of a good heart, and a good countenance thou shalt hardly find, and with labour. </div><ul class='tnav'>
