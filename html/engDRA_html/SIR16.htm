He is mighty to forgive, and to pour out indignation:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>According as his mercy is, so his correction judgeth a man according to his works.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The sinner shall not escape in his rapines, and the patience of him that sheweth mercy shall not be put off.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>All mercy shall make a place for every man according to the merit of his works, and according to the wisdom of his sojournment.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Say not: I shall be hidden from God. and who shall remember me from on high?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>In such a multitude I shall not be known: for what is my soul in such an immense creation?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Behold the heaven, and the heavens of heavens, the deep, and all the earth, and the things that are in them, shall be moved in his sight,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The mountains also, and the hills, and the foundations of the earth: when God shall look upon them, they shall be shaken with trembling.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And in all these things the heart is senseless: and every heart is understood by him:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And his ways who shall understand, and the storm, which no eye of man see?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For many of his works are hidden: hut the works of his justice who shall declare? or who shall endure? for the testament is far from some, and the examination of all is in the end.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>He that wanteth understanding thinketh vain things: and the foolish, and erring man, thinketh foolish things.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Hearken to me, my son, and learn the discipline of understanding, and attend to my words in thy heart.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And I will shew forth good doctrine in equity, and will seek to declare wisdom: and attend to my words in thy heart, whilst with equity of spirit I tell thee the virtues that God hath put upon his works from the beginning, and I shew forth in truth his knowledge.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>The works of God are done in judgment from the beginning, and from the making of them he distinguished their parts, and their beginnings in their generations.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>He beautified their works for ever, they have neither hungered, nor laboured, and they have not ceased from their works.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Nor shall any of them straiten his neighbour at any time.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Be not thou incredulous to his word.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>After this God looked upon the earth, and filled it with his goods.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The soul of every living thing hath shewn forth before the face thereof, and into it they return again. </div><ul class='tnav'>
