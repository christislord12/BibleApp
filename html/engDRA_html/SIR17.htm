Praise perisheth from the dead as nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Give thanks whilst thou art living, whilst thou art alive and in health thou shalt give thanks, and shalt praise God, and shalt glory in his mercies.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>How great is the mercy of the Lord, and his forgiveness to them that turn to him!  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For all things cannot be in men, because the son of man is not immortal, and they are delighted with the vanity of evil.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>What is brighter than the sun; yet it shall be eclipsed. Or what is more wicked than that which flesh and blood hath invented? and this shall be reproved.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>He beholdeth the power of the height of heaven: and all men are earth and ashes. </div><ul class='tnav'>
