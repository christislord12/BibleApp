God only shall be justified, and he remaineth an invincible king for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Who is able to declare his works?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For who shall search out his glorious acts?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And who shall shew forth the power of his majesty? or who shall be able to declare his mercy?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Nothing may be taken away, nor added, neither is it possible to find out the glorious works of God:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>When a man hath done, then shall he begin: and when he leaveth off, he shall be at a loss.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>What is man, and what is his grace? and what is his good, or what is his evil?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The number of the days of men at the most are a hundred years: as a drop of water of the sea are they esteemed: and as a pebble of the sand, so are a few years compared to eternity.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Therefore God is patient in them, and poureth forth his mercy upon them.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He hath seen the presumption of their heart that it is wicked, and hath known their end that it is evil.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Therefore bath he filled up his mercy in their favour, and hath shewn them the way of justice.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The compassion of man is toward his neighbour: but the mercy of God is upon all flesh.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He hath mercy, and teacheth, and correcteth, as a shepherd doth his hock.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He hath mercy on him that receiveth the discipline of mercy, and that maketh haste in his judgments.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>My son, in thy good deeds, make no complaint, and when thou givest any thing, add not grief by an evil word.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Shall not the dew assuage the heat? so also the good word is better than the gift.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Lo, is not a word better than a gift? but both are with a justified man.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>A fool will upbraid bitterly: and a gift of one ill taught consumeth the eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Before judgment prepare thee justice, and learn before thou speak.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Before sickness take a medicine, and before judgment examine thyself, and thou shalt find mercy in the sight of God.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Humble thyself before thou art sick, and in the time of sickness shew thy conversation.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Let nothing hinder thee from praying always, and be not afraid to be justified even to death: for the reward of God continueth for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Before prayer prepare thy soul: and be not as a man that tempteth God.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Remember the wrath that shall be at the last day, and the time of repaying when he shall turn away his face.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Remember poverty is the time of abundance, and the necessities of poverty in the day of riches.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>From the morning until the evening the time shall be changed, and all these are swift in the eyes of God.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>A wise man will fear in every thing, and in the days of sins will beware of sloth.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Every man of understanding knoweth wisdom, and will give praise to him that findeth her.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>They that were of good understanding in words, have also done wisely themselves: and have understood truth and justice, and have poured forth proverbs and judgments.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Go not after thy lusts, but turn away from thy own will.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>If thou give to thy soul her desires, she will make thee a joy to thy enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Take no pleasure in riotous assemblies, be they ever so small: for their concertation is continual.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Make not thyself poor by borrowing to contribute to feasts when thou hast nothing in thy purse: for thou shalt be an enemy to thy own life. </div><ul class='tnav'>
