<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 19</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>A workman that is a drunkard shall not be rich: and he that contemneth small things, shall fall by little and little.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Wine and women make wise men fall off, and shall rebuke the prudent.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And he that joineth himself to harlots, will be wicked. Rottenness and worms shall inherit him, and he shall be lifted up for a greater example, and his soul shall be taken away out of the number.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>He that is hasty to give credit, is light of heart, and shall be lessened: and he that sinneth against his own soul, shall be despised.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>He that rejoiceth in iniquity, shall be censured, and he that hateth chastisement, shall have less life: and he that hateth babbling, extinguisheth evil.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>He that sinneth against his own soul, shall repent: and he that is delighted with wickedness, shall be condemned.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Rehearse not again a wicked and harsh word, and thou shalt not fare the worse.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Tell not thy mind to friend or foe: and if there be a sin with thee, disclose it not.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For he will hearken to thee, and will watch thee, and as it were defending thy sin he will hate thee, and so will he be with thee always.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Hast thou heard a word against thy neighbour? let it die within thee, trusting that it will not burst thee.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>At the hearing of a word the fool is in travail, as a woman groaning. in the bringing forth a child.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>As an arrow that sticketh in a man’s thigh: so is a word in the heart of a fool.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Reprove a friend, lest he may not have understood, and say: I did it not: or if he did it, that he may do it no more.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Reprove thy neighbour, for it may be he hath not said it: and if he hath said it, that he may not say it again.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Admonish thy friend: for there is often a fault committed.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And believe not every word. There is one, that slippeth with the tongue, but not from his heart.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For who is there that hath not offended with his tongue? Admonish thy neighbour before thou threaten him.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And give place to the fear of the most High: for the fear of God is all wisdom, and therein is to fear God, and the disposition of the law is in all wisdom.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But the learning of wickedness is not wisdom: and the device of sinners is not prudence.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>There is a subtle wickedness, and the same is detestable: and there is a man that is foolish, wanting in wisdom.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Better is a man that hath less wisdom, and wanteth understanding, with the fear of God, than he that aboundeth in understanding, and transgresseth the law of the most High.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>There is an exquisite subtilty, and the same is unjust.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And there is one that uttereth an exact word telling the truth. There is one that humbleth himself wickedly, and his interior is full of deceit:  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And there is one that submitteth himself exceedingly with a great lowliness: and there is one that casteth down his countenance, and maketh as if he did not see that which is unknown:  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And if he be hindered from sinning for want of power, if he shall find opportunity to do evil, he will do it.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>A man is known by his look, and a wise man, when thou meetest him, is known by his countenance.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The attire of the body, and the laughter of the teeth, and the gait of the man, shew what he is.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>There is a lying rebuke in the anger of an injurious man: and there is a judgment that is not allowed to be good: and there is one that holdeth his peace, he is wise. </div><ul class='tnav'>
