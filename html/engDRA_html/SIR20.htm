How often, and how many will laugh him to scorn!  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For he doth not distribute with right understanding that which was to be had: in like manner also that which was not to be had.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The slipping of a false tongue is as one that falleth on the pavement: so the fall of the wicked shall come speedily.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>A man without grace is as a vain fable, it shall be continually in the mouth of the unwise.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>A parable coming out, of a fool’s mouth shall be rejected: for he doth not speak it in due season.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>There is that is hindered from sinning through want, and in his rest he shall be pricked.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>There is that will destroy his own soul through shamefacedness, and by occasion of an unwise person he will destroy it: and by respect of person he will destroy himself.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>There is that for bashfulness promiseth to his friend, and maketh him his enemy for nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>A lie is a foul blot in a man, and yet it will be continually in the mouth of men without discipline.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>A thief is better than a man that is always lying: but both of them shall inherit destruction.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>The manners of lying men are without honour: and their confusion is with them without ceasing.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>A wise man shall advance himself with his words, and a prudent man shall please the great ones.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>He that tilleth his land shall make a high heap of corn: and he that worketh justice shall be exalted: and he that pleaseth great men shall escape iniquity.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Presents and gifts blind the eyes of judges, and make them dumb in the mouth, so that they cannot correct.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Wisdom that is hid, and treasure that is not seen: what profit is there in them both?  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Better is he that hideth his folly, than the man that hideth his wisdom. </div><ul class='tnav'>
