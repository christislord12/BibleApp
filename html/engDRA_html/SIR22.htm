To a friend,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>If thou hast opened a sad mouth, fear not, for there may be a reconciliation: except upbraiding, and reproach, and pride, and disclosing of secrets, or a treacherous wound: for in all these cases a friend will flee away.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Keep fidelity with a friend in his poverty, that in his prosperity also thou mayst rejoice.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>In the time of his trouble continue faithful to him, that thou mayst also be heir with him in his inheritance.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>As the vapour of a chimney, and the smoke of the fire goeth up before the fire: so also injurious words, and reproaches, and threats, before blood.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>I will not be ashamed to salute a friend, neither will I hide myself from his face: and if any evil happen to me by him, I will bear it.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But every one that shall hear it, will beware of him.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Who will set a guard before my mouth, and a sure seal upon my lips, that I fall not by them, and that my tongue destroy me not? </div><ul class='tnav'>
