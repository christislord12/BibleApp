<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 23</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>O Lord, father, and sovereign ruler of my life, leave me not to their counsel: nor suffer me to fall by them.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Who will set scourges over my thoughts, and the discipline of wisdom over my heart, that they spare me not in their ignorances, and that their sins may not appear:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Lest my ignorance increase, and my offences be multiplied, and my sins abound, and I fall before my adversaries, and my enemy rejoice over me?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>O Lord, father, and God of my life, leave me not to their devices.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Give me not haughtiness of my eyes, and turn away from me all coveting.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Take from me the greediness of the belly, and let not the lusts of the flesh take hold of me, and give me not over to a shameless and foolish mind.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Hear, O ye children, the discipline of the mouth: and he that will keep it shall not perish by his lips, nor be brought to fall into most wicked works.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>A sinner is caught in his own vanity, and the proud and the evil speakers shall fall thereby.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Let not thy mouth be accustomed to swearing: for in it there are many falls.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And let not the naming of God be usual in thy mouth, and meddle not with the names of saints, for thou shalt not escape free from them.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For as a slave daily put to the question, is never without a blue mark: so every one that sweareth, and nameth, shall not be wholly pure from sin.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>A man that sweareth much, shall be filled with iniquity, and a scourge shall not depart from his house.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And if he make it void, his sin shall be upon him: and if he dissemble it, he offendeth double:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And if he swear in vain, he shall not be justified: for his house shall be filled with his punishment.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>There is also another speech opposite to death, let it not be found in the inheritance of Jacob.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For from the merciful all these things shall be taken away, and they shall not wallow in sins.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Let not thy mouth be accustomed to indiscreet speech: for therein is the word of sin.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Remember thy father and thy mother, for thou sittest is the midst of great men:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Lest God forget thee in their sight, and thou, by thy daily custom, be infatuated and suffer reproach: and wish that thou hadst not been born, and curse the day of thy nativity.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The man that is accustomed to opprobrious words, will never be corrected all the days of his life.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Two sorts of men multiply sins, and the third bringeth wrath and destruction.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>A hot soul is a burning fire, it will never be quenched, till it devour some thing.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And a man that is wicked in the mouth of his flesh, will not leave off till he hath kindled a fire.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>To a man that is a fornicator all bread is sweet, he will not be weary of sinning unto the end.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Every man that passeth beyond his own bed, despising his own soul, and saying: Who seeth me?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Darkness compasseth me about, and the walls cover me, and no man seeth me: whom do I fear? the most High will not remember my sins.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And he understandeth not that his eye seeth all things, for such a man’s fear driveth from him the fear of God, and the eyes of men fearing him:  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And he knoweth not that the eyes of the Lord are far brighter than the sun, beholding round about all the ways of men, and the bottom of the deep, and looking into the hearts of men, into the most hidden parts.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For all things were known to the Lord God, before they were created: so also after they were perfected he beholdeth all things.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>This man shall be punished in the streets of the city, and he shall be chased as a colt: and where he suspected not, he shall be taken.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And he shall be in disgrace with all men, because he understood not the fear of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>So every woman also that leaveth her husband, and bringeth in an heir by another:  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>For first she hath been unfaithful to the law of the most High: and secondly, she hath offended against her husband: thirdly, she hath fornicated in adultery, and hath gotten her children of another man.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>This woman shall be brought into the assembly, and inquisition shall be made of her children.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Her children shall not take root, and her branches shall bring forth no fruit.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>She shall leave her memory to be cursed, and her infamy shall not be blotted out.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And they that remain shall know. that there is nothing better than the fear of God: and that there is nothing sweeter than to have regard to the commandments of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>It is great glory to follow the Lord for length of days shall be received from him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
