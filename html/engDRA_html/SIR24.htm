<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 24</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Wisdom shall praise her own self, and shall be honoured in God, and shall glory in the midst of her people,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And shall open her mouth in the churches of the most High, and shall glorify herself in the sight of his power,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And in the midst of her own people she shall be exalted, and shall be admired in the holy assembly.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And in the multitude of the elect she shall have praise, and among the blessed she shall be blessed, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>I came out of the mouth of the most High, the firstborn before all creatures:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I made that in the heavens there should rise light that never faileth, and as a cloud I covered all the earth:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I dwelt in the highest places, and my throne is in a pillar of a cloud.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I alone have compassed the circuit of heaven, and have penetrated into the bottom of the deep, and have walked in the waves of the sea,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And have stood in all the earth: and in every people,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And in every nation I have had the chief rule:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And by my power I have trodden under my feet the hearts of all the high and low: and in all these I sought rest, and I shall abide in the inheritance of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then the creator of all things commanded, and said to me: and he that made me, rested in my tabernacle,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And he said to me: Let thy dwelling be in Jacob, and thy inheritance in Israel, and take root in my elect.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>From the beginning, and before the world, was I created, and unto the world to come I shall not cease to be, and in the holy dwelling place I have ministered before him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And so was I established in Sion, and in the holy city likewise I rested, and my power was in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And I took root in an honourable people, and in the portion of my God his inheritance, and my abode is in the full assembly of saints.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>I was exalted like a cedar in Libanus, and as a cypress tree on mount Sion.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I was exalted like a palm tree in Cades, and as a rose plant in Jericho:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>As a fair olive tree in the plains, and as a plane tree by the water in the streets, was I exalted.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>I gave a sweet smell like cinnamon. and aromatical balm: I yielded a sweet odour like the best myrrh:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And I perfumed my dwelling as storax, and galbanum, and onyx, and aloes, and as the frankincense not cut, and my odour is as the purest balm.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>I have stretched out my branches as the turpentine tree, and my branches are of honour and grace.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>As the vine I have brought forth a pleasant odour: and my flowers are the fruit of honour and riches.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>I am the mother of fair love, and of fear, and of knowledge, and of holy hope.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>In me is all grace of the way and of the truth, in me is all hope of life and of virtue.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Come over to me, all ye that desire me, and be filled with my fruits.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For my spirit is sweet above honey, and my inheritance above honey and the honeycomb.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>My memory is unto everlasting generations.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>They that eat me, shall yet hunger: and they that drink me, shall yet thirst.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>He that hearkeneth to me, shall not be confounded: and they that work by me, shall not sin.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>They that explain me shall have life everlasting.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>All these things are the book of life, and the covenant of the most High, and the knowledge of truth.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Moses commanded a law in the precepts of justices, and an inheritance to the house of Jacob, and the promises to Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>He appointed to David his servant to raise up of him a most mighty king, and sitting on the throne of glory for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Who filleth up wisdom as the Phison, and as the Tigris in the days of the new fruits.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Who maketh understanding to abound as the Euphrates, who multiplieth it as the Jordan in the time of harvest.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Who sendeth knowledge as the light, and riseth up as Gehon in the time of the vintage.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Who first hath perfect knowledge of her, and a weaker shall not search her out.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>For her thoughts are more vast than the sea, and her counsels more deep than the great ocean.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>I, wisdom, have poured out rivers.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>I, like a brook out of a river of a mighty water; I, like a channel of a river. and like an aqueduct, came out of paradise.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>I said: I will water my garden of plants, and I will water abundantly the fruits of my meadow.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And behold my brook became a great river, and my river came near to a sea:  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>For I make doctrine to shine forth to all as the morning light, and I will declare it afar off.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>I will penetrate to all the lower parts of the earth, and will behold all that sleep, and will enlighten all that hope in the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>I will yet pour out doctrine as prophecy, and will leave it to them that seek wisdom, and will not cease to instruct their offspring even to the holy age.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>See ye that I have not laboured for myself only, but for all that seek out the truth. </div><ul class='tnav'>
