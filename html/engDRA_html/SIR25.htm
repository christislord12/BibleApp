It will be more agreeable to abide with a lion and a dragon, than to dwell with a wicked woman.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The wickedness of a woman changeth her face: and she darkeneth her countenance as a bear: and sheweth it like sackcloth. In the midst of her neighbours,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Her husband groaned, and hearing he sighed a little.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>All malice is shore to the malice of a woman, let the lot of sinners fall upon her.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>As the climbing of a sandy way is to the feet of the aged, so is a wife full of tongue to a quiet man.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Look not upon a woman’s beauty, and desire not a woman for beauty.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>A woman’s anger, and impudence, and confusion is great.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>A woman, if she have superiority, is contrary to her husband.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>A wicked woman abateth the courage, and maketh a heavy countenance, and a wounded heart.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Feeble hands, and disjointed knees, a woman that doth not make her husband happy.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>From the woman came the beginning of sin, and by her we all die.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Give no issue to thy water, no, not a little: nor to a wicked woman liberty to gad abroad.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>If she walk not at thy hand, she will confound thee in the sight of thy enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Cut her off from thy flesh, lest she always abuse thee. </div><ul class='tnav'>
