And of a curse there is reconciliation:  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But to disclose the secrets of a friend, leaveth no hope to an unhappy soul.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>He that winketh with the eye forgeth wicked things, and no man will cast him off:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>In the sight of thy eyes he will sweeten his mouth, and will admire thy words: but at the last he will writhe his mouth, and on thy words he will lay a stumblingblock.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>I have hated many things, but not like him, and the Lord will hate him.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>If one cast a stone on high, it will fall upon his own head: and the deceitful stroke will wound the deceitful.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>He that diggeth a pit, shall fall into it: and he that setteth a stone for his neighbour, shall stumble upon it: and he that layeth a snare for another, shall perish in it.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>A mischievous counsel shall be rolled back upon the author, and he shall not know from whence it cometh to him.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Mockery and reproach are of the proud, and vengeance as a lion shall lie in wait for him.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>They shall perish in a snare that are delighted with the fall of the just: and sorrow shall consume them before they die.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Anger and fury are both of them abominable, and the sinful man shall be subject to them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
