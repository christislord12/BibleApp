He that could have transgressed, and hath not transgressed: and could do evil things, and hath not done them:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Therefore are his goods established in the Lord, and all the church of the saints shall declare his alms.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Art thou set at a great table? be not the first to open thy mouth upon it.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Say not: There are many things which are upon it.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Remember that a wicked eye is evil.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>What is created more wicked than an eye? therefore shall it weep over all the face when it shall see.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Stretch not out thy hand first, lest being disgraced with envy thou be put to confusion.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Be not hasty in a feast.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Judge of the disposition of thy neighbour by thyself.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Use as a frugal man the things that are set before thee: lest if thou eatest much, thou be hated.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Leave off first, for manners’ sake: and exceed not, lest thou offend.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And if thou sittest among many, reach not thy hand out first of all: and be not the first to ask for drink.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>How sufficient is a little wine for a man well taught, and in sleeping thou shalt not be uneasy with it, and thou shalt feel no pain.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Watching, and choler, and gripes, are with an intemperate man:  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Sound and wholesome sleep with a moderate man: he shall sleep till morning, and his soul shall be delighted with him.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And if thou hast been forced to eat much, arise, go out, and vomit: and it shall refresh thee, and thou shalt not bring sickness upon thy body.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Hear me, my son, and despise me not: and in the end thou shalt find my words.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>In all thy works be quick, and no infirmity shall come to thee.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>The lips of many shall bless him that is liberal of his bread, and the testimony of his truth is faithful.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Against him that is niggardly of his bread, the city will murmur, and the testimony of his niggardliness is true.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Challenge not them that love wine: for wine hath destroyed very many.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Fire trieth hard iron: so wine drunk to excess shall rebuke the hearts of the proud.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Wine taken with sobriety is equal lire to men: if thou drink it moderately, thou shalt be sober.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>What is his life, who is diminished with wine?  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>What taketh away life? death.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Wine was created from the beginning to make men joyful, and not to make them drunk.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Wine drunken with moderation is the joy of the soul and the heart.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Sober drinking is health to soul and body.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Wine drunken with excess raiseth quarrels; and wrath, and many ruins.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Wine drunken with excess is bitterness of the soul.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>The heat of drunkenness is the stumblingblock of the fool, lessening strength and causing wounds.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Rebuke not thy neighbour in a banquet of wine: and despise him not in hip mirth.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Speak not to him words of reproach: and press him not in demanding again. </div><ul class='tnav'>
