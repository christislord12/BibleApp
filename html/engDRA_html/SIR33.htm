And all men are from the ground, and out of the earth, from whence Adam was created.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>With much knowledge the Lord hath divided them and diversified their ways.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Some of them hath he blessed, and exalted: and some of them hath he sanctified, and set near himself: and some of them hath he cursed and brought low, and turned them from their station.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>As the potter’s clay is in his hand, to fashion and order it:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>All his ways are according to his ordering: so man is in the hand of him that made him, and he will render to him according to his judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Good is set against evil, and life against death: so also is the sinner against a just man. And so look upon all the works of the most High. Two and two, and one against another.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And I awaked last of all, and as one that gathereth after the grapegatherers.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>In the blessing of God I also have hoped: and as one that gathereth grapes, have I filled the winepress.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>See that I have not laboured for myself only, but for all that seek discipline.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Hear me, ye great men, and all ye people, and hearken with your ears, ye rulers of the church.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Give not to son or wife, brother or friend, power over thee while thou livest; and give not thy estate to another, lest then repent, and thou entreat for the same.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>As long as thou livest, and hast breath in thee, let no man change thee.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For it is better that thy children should ask of thee, than that thou look toward the hands of thy children.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>In all thy works keep the pre-eminence.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Let no stain sully thy glory. In the time when thou shalt end the days of thy life, and in the time of thy decease, distribute thy inheritance.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Fodder, and a wand, and a burden are for an ass: bread, and correction, and work for a slave.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>He worketh under correction, and seeketh to rest: let his hands be idle, and he seeketh liberty.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The yoke and the thong bend a stiff neck, and continual labours bow a slave.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Torture and fetters are for a malicious slave: send him to work, that he be not idle:  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For idleness hath taught much evil.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Set him to work: for so it is fit for him. And if he be not obedient, bring him down with fetters, but be not excessive towards any one: and do no grievous thing without judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>If thou have a faithful servant, let him be to thee as thy own soul: treat him as a brother: because in the blood of thy soul thou hast gotten him.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>If thou hurt him unjustly, he will run away:  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And if he rise up and depart, thou knowest not whom to ask, and in what way to seek him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
