<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 34</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>The hopes of a man that is void of understanding are vain and deceitful: and dreams lift up fools.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The man that giveth heed to lying visions, is like to him that catcheth at a shadow, and followeth after the wind.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The vision of dreams is the resemblance of one thing to another: as when a man’s likeness is before the face of a man.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>What can be made clean by the unclean? and what truth can come from that which is false?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Deceitful divinations and lying omens and the dreams of evildoers, are vanity:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the heart fancieth as that of a woman in travail: except it be a vision sent forth from the most High, set no thy heart upon them.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For dreams have deceived many, and they have failed that put their trust in them.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The word of the law shall be fulfilled without a lie, and wisdom shall be made plain in the mouth of the faithful.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>What doth he know, that hath not been tried? A man that hath much experience, shall think of many things: and he that hath learned many things, shall shew forth understanding.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He that hath no experience, knoweth little: and he that hath been experienced in many things, multiplieth prudence.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>He that hath not been tried, what manner of things doth he know? he that hath been surprised, shall abound with subtlety.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I have seen many things by travelling, and many customs of things.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Sometimes I have been in danger of death for these things, and I have been delivered by the grace of God.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The spirit of those that fear God; is sought after, and by his regard shall be blessed.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For their hope is on him that saveth them, and the eyes of God are upon them that love him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He that feareth the Lord shall tremble at nothing, and shall not be afraid for he is his hope.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The soul of him that feareth the Lord is blessed.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>To whom doth he look, and who in his strength?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The eyes of the Lord are upon them that fear him, he is their powerful protector, and strong stay, a defence from the heat, and a cover from the sun at noon,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>A preservation from stumbling, and a help from falling; he raiseth up the soul, and enlighteneth the eyes, and giveth health, and life, and blessing.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The offering of him that sacrificeth of a thing wrongfully gotten, is stained, and the mockeries of the unjust are not acceptable.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The Lord is only for them that wait upon him in the way of truth and justice.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The most High approveth not the gifts of the wicked: neither hath he respect to the oblations of the unjust, nor will he be pacified for sins by the multitude of their sacrifices.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>He that offereth sacrifice of the goods of the poor, is as one that sacrificeth the son in the presence of his father.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The bread of the needy, is the life of the poor: he that defraudeth them thereof, is a man of blood.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>He that taketh away the bread gotten by sweat, is like him that killeth his neighbour.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>He that sheddeth blood, and he that defraudeth the labourer of his hire, are brothers.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>When one buildeth up, and another pulleth down: what profit have they but the labour?  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>When one prayeth, and another curseth: whose voice will God hear?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>He that washeth himself after touching the dead, if he toucheth him again, what doth his washing avail?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>So a man that fasteth for his sins, and doth the same again, what doth his humbling himself profit him? who will hear his prayer? </div><ul class='tnav'>
