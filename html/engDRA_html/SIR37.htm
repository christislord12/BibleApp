<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 37</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Every friend will say: I also am his friend: but there is a friend, that is only a friend in name. Is not this a grief even to death?  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>But a companion and a friend shall be turned to an enemy.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>O wicked presumption, whence camest thou to cover the earth with thy malice, and deceitfulness?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>There is a companion who rejoiceth with his friend in his joys, but in the time of trouble, he will be against him.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>There is a companion who condoleth with his friend for his belly’s sake, and he will take up a shield against enemy.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Forget not thy friend in thy mind, and be not unmindful of him in thy riches.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Consult not with him that layeth a snare for thee, and hide thy counsel from them that envy thee.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Every counsellor giveth out counsel, but there is one that is a counsellor for himself.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Beware of a counsellor. And know before what need he hath: for he will devise to his own mind:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Lest he thrust a stake into the ground, and say to thee:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Thy way is good; and then stand on the other side to see what shall befall thee.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Treat not with a man without religion concerning holiness, nor with an unjust man concerning justice, nor with a woman touching her of whom she is jealous, nor with a coward concerning war, nor with a merchant about traffic, nor with a buyer of selling, nor with an envious man of giving thanks,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Nor with the ungodly of piety, nor with the dishonest of honesty, nor with the held labourer of every work,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Nor with him that worketh by the year of the finishing of the year, nor with an idle servant of much business: give no heed to these in any matter of counsel.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But be continually with a holy man, whomsoever thou shalt know to observe the fear of God,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Whose soul is according to thy own soul: and who, when thou shalt stumble in the dark, will be sorry for thee.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And establish within thyself a heart of good counsel: for there is no other thing of more worth to thee than it.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The soul of a holy man discovereth sometimes true things, more than seven watchmen that sit in a high piece to watch.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But above all these things pray to the most High, that he may direct thy way in truth.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>In all thy works let the true word go before thee, and steady counsel before every action.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>A wicked word shall change the beast: out of which four manner of things arise, good and evil, life and death: and the tongue is continually the ruler of them. There is a man that is subtle and a teacher of many, and yet is unprofitable to his own soul.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>A skillful man hath taught many, and is sweet to his own soul.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>He that speaketh sophistically, is hateful: he shall be destitute of every thing.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Grace is not given him from the Lord: for he is deprived of all wisdom.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>There is a wise man that is wise to his own soul: and the fruit of his understanding is commendable.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>A wise man instructeth his own people, and the fruits of his understanding are faithful.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>A wise man shall be filled with blessings, and they that see shall praise him.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>The life of a man is in the number of his days: but the days of Israel are innumerable.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>A wise man shall inherit honour among his people, and his name shall live for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>My son, prove thy soul in thy life: and if it be wicked, give it no power:  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For all things are not expedient for all, and every kind pleaseth not every soul.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Be not greedy in any feasting, and pour not out thyself upon any meat:  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>For in many meats there will be sickness, and greediness will turn to choler.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>By surfeiting many have perished: but he that is temperate, shall prolong life. </div><ul class='tnav'>
