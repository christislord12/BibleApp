The vapour of the fire wasteth his flesh, and he fighteth with the heat of the furnace.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>The noise of the hammer is always in his ears, and his eye is upon the pattern of the vessel he maketh.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>He setteth his mind to finish his work, and his watching to polish them, to perfection.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>So doth the potter sitting at his work, turning the wheel about with his feet, who is always carefully set to his work, and maketh all his work by number:  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>He fashioneth the clay with his arm, and boweth down his strength before his feet:  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>He shall give his mind to finish the glazing, and his watching to make clean the furnace.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>All these trust to their hands, and every one is wise in his own art.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Without these a city is not built.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And they shall not dwell, nor walk about therein, and they shall not go up into the assembly.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Upon the judges’ seat they shall not sit, and the ordinance of judgment they shall not understand, neither shall they declare discipline and judgment, and they shall not be found where parables are spoken:  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>But they shall strengthen the state of the world, and their prayer shall be in the work of their craft, applying their soul, and searching in the law of the most High. </div><ul class='tnav'>
