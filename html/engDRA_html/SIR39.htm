for all things shall be sought in their time.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>His blessing hath overflowed like a river.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And as a flood hath watered the earth; so shall his wrath inherit the nations, that have not sought after him:  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Even as he turned the waters into a dry land, and the earth was made dry: and his ways were made plain for their journey: so to sinners they are stumblingblocks in his wrath.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Good things were created for the good from the beginning, so for the wicked, good and evil things.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The principal things necessary for the life of men, are water, fire, and iron, salt, milk, and bread of flour, and honey, and the cluster of the grape, and oil, and clothing.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>All these things shall be for good to the holy, so to the sinners and the ungodly they shall be turned into evil.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>There are spirits that are created for vengeance, and in their fury they lay on grievous torments.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>In the time of destruction they shall pour out their force: and they shall appease the wrath of him that made them.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Fire, hail, famine, and death, all these were created for vengeance.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>The teeth of beasts, and scorpions, and serpents, and the sword taking vengeance upon the ungodly unto destruction.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>In his commandments they shall feast, and they shall be ready upon earth when need is, and when their time is come they shall not transgress his word.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Therefore from the beginning I was resolved, and I have meditated, and thought on these things and left them in writing.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>All the works of the Lord are good, and he will furnish every work in due time.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>It is not to be said: This is worse than that: for all shall be well approved in their time.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Now therefore with the whole heart and mouth praise ye him, and bless the name of the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
