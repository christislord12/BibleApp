In the time of his safety he rose up, and wondereth that there is no fear:  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Such things happen to all flesh, from man even to beast, and upon sinners are sevenfold mere.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Moreover, death, and bloodshed, strife, and sword, oppressions, famine, and affliction, and scourges:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>All these things are created for the wicked, and for their sakes came the flood.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>All things that are of the earth, shall return to the earth again, and all waters shall return to the sea.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>All bribery, and injustice shall blotted out, and fidelity shall stand for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The riches of the unjust shall be dried up like a river, and shall pass sway a noise like a great thunder in rain.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>While he openeth his hands he shall rejoice: but transgressors shall pine away in the end.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The offspring of the ungodly shall not bring forth many branches, and make a noise as unclean roots upon the top of a rock.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The weed growing over every water, and at the bank of the river, shall be pulled up before all grass.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Grace is like a paradise in blessings, and mercy remaineth for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The life of a labourer that is content with what he hath, shall be sweet, and in it thou shalt find a treasure.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Children, and the building of a city shall establish a name, but a blameless wife shall be counted above them both.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Wine and music rejoice the heart, but the love of wisdom is above them both.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The flute and the psaltery make a sweet melody, but a pleasant tongue is above them both.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Thy eye desireth favour and beauty, but more than these green sown fields.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>A friend and companion meeting together in season, but above them both is a wife with her husband.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Brethren are a help in the time of trouble, but mercy shall deliver more than they.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Gold and silver make the feet stand sure: but wise counsel is above them both.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Riches and strength lift up the heart: but above these is the fear of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>There is no want in the fear of the Lord, and it needeth not to seek for help.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>The fear of the Lord is like a paradise of blessing, and they have covered it above all glory.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>My son, in thy lifetime be not indigent: for it is better to die than to want.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>The life of him that looketh toward another man’s table is not to be counted a life: for he feedeth his soul with another man’s meat.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>But a man, well instructed and taught, will look to himself.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Begging will be sweet in the mouth of the unwise, but in his belly there shall burn a fire. </div><ul class='tnav'>
