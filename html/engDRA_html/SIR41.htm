Remember what things have been before thee, and what shall come after thee: this sentence is from the Lord upon all flesh.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And what shall come upon thee by the good pleasure of the most High? Whether ten, or a hundred, or a thousand years.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For among the dead there is no accusing of life.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The children of sinners become children of abominations, and they that converse near the houses of the ungodly.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The inheritance of the children of sinners shall perish, and with their posterity shall be a perpetual reproach.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The children will complain of an ungodly father, because for his sake they are in reproach.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Woe to you, ungodly men, who have forsaken the law of the most high Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And if you be born, you shall be born in malediction: and if you die, in malediction shall be your portion.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>All things that are of the earth, shall return into the earth: so the ungodly shall from malediction to destruction.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The mourning of men is about their body, but the name of the ungodly shall be blotted out.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Take care of a good name: for this shall continue with thee, more than a thousand treasures precious and great.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>A good life hath its number of days: but a good name shall continue for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>My children, keep discipline in peace: for wisdom that is hid, and a treasure that is not seen, what profit is there in them both?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Better is the man that hideth his folly, then the man that hideth his wisdom.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Wherefore have a shame of these things I am now going to speak of.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For it is not good to keep all shamefacedness: and all things do not please all men in opinion.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Be ashamed of fornication before father and mother: and of a lie before a governor and a man in power:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Of an offence before a prince, and a judge: of iniquity before a congregation and a people:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Of injustice before a companion and friend: and in regard to the place where thou dwellest,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Of theft, and of the truth of God, and the covenant: of leaning with thy elbow over meat, and of deceit in giving and taking:  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Of silence before them that salute thee: of looking upon a harlot: and of turning away thy face from thy kinsman.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Turn not sway thy face from thy neighbour, and of taking away a portion and not restoring.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Gaze not upon another man’s wife, and be not inquisitive after his handmaid, and approach not her bed.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Be ashamed of upbraiding speeches before friends: and after thou hast given, upbraid not. </div><ul class='tnav'>
