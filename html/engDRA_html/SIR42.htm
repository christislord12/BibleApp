By the words of the Lord are his works.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The sun giving light hath looked upon all things, and full of the glory of the Lord is his work.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Hath not the Lord made the saints to declare all his wonderful works, which the Lord Almighty hath firmly settled to be established for his glory?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>He hath searched out the deep, and the heart of men: and considered their crafty devices.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For the Lord knoweth all knowledge, and hath beheld the signs of the world, he declareth the things that are past, and the things that are to come, and revealeth the traces of hidden things.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>No thought escapeth him, and no word can hide itself from him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>He hath beautified the glorious works of his wisdom: and he Is from eternity to eternity, and to him nothing may be added,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Nor can he be diminished, and he hath no need of any counsellor.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>O how desirable are all his works, and what we can know is but as a spark!  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>All these things live, and remain for ever, and for every use all things obey him.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>All things are double, one against another, and he hath made nothing defective.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>He hath established the good things of every one. And who shall be filled with beholding his glory? </div><ul class='tnav'>
