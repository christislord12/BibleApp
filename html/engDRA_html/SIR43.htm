As one keeping a furnace in the works of heat:  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The sun three times as much, burneth the mountains, breathing out fiery vapours, and shining with his beams, he blindeth the eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Great is the Lord that made him, and at his words he hath hastened his course.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the moon in all in her season, is for a declaration of times and a sign of the world.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>From the moon is the sign of the festival day, a light that decreaseth in her perfection.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The month is called after her name, increasing wonderfully in her perfection.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Being an instrument of the armies on high, shining gloriously in the Armament of heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The glory of the stars is the beauty of heaven; the Lord enlighteneth the world on high.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>By the words of the holy one they shall stand in judgment, and shall never fail in their watches.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Look upon the rainbow, and bless him that made it: it is very beautiful in its brightness.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>It encompasseth the heaven about with the circle of its glory, the hands of the most High have displayed it.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>By his commandment he maketh the snow to fall apace, and sendeth forth swiftly the lightnings of his judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Through this are the treasures opened, and the clouds fly out like birds.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>By his greatness he hath fixed the clouds, and the hailstones are broken.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>At his sight shall the mountains be shaken, and at his will the south wind shall blow.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The noise of his thunder shall strike the earth, so doth the northern storm, and the whirlwind:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And as the birds lighting upon the earth, he scattereth snow, and the falling thereof, is as the coming down of locusts.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The eye admireth at the beauty of the whiteness thereof, and the heart is astonished at the shower thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>He shall pour frost as salt upon the earth: and when it freezeth, it shall become like the tops of thistles.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The cold north wind bloweth, and the water is congealed into crystal; upon every gathering together of waters it shall rest, and shall clothe the waters as a breastplate.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And it shall devour the mountains, and burn the wilderness, and consume all that is green as with fire.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>A present remedy of all is the speedy coming of a cloud, and a dew that meeteth it, by the heat that cometh, shall overpower it.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>At his word the wind is still, and with his thought he appeaseth the deep, and the Lord hath planted islands therein.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Let them that sail on the sea, tell the dangers thereof: and when we hear with our ears, we shall admire.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>There are great and wonderful works: a variety of beasts, and of all living things, and the monstrous creatures of whales.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Through him is established the end of their journey, and by his word all things are regulated.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>We shall say much, and yet shall want words: but the sum of our words is, He is all.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>What shall we be able to do to glorify him? for the Almighty himself is above all his works.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The Lord is terrible, and exceeding great, and his power is admirable.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Glorify the Lord as much as ever you can, for he will yet far exceed, and his magnificence is wonderful.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Blessing the Lord, exalt him as much as you can: for he is above all praise.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>When you exalt him put forth all your strength, and be not weary: for you can never go far enough.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Who shall see him, and declare him? and who shall magnify him as he is from the beginning?  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>There are many things hidden from us that are greater than these: for we have seen but a few of his works.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>But the Lord hath made all things, and to the godly he hath given wisdom. </div><ul class='tnav'>
