And he followed the mighty one:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And in the days of Moses he did a work of mercy, he and Caleb the son of Jephone, in standing against the enemy, and withholding the people from sins, and appeasing the wicked murmuring.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And they two being appointed, were delivered out of the danger from among the number of six hundred thousand men on foot, to bring them into their inheritance, into the land that floweth with milk and honey.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the Lord gave strength also to Caleb, and his strength continued even to his old age, so that he went up to the high places of the land, and his seed obtained it for an inheritance:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>That all the children of Israel might see, that it is good to obey the holy God.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then all the judges, every one by name, whose heart was not corrupted: who turned not away from the Lord,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>That their memory might be blessed, and their bones spring up out of their place,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And their name continue for ever, the glory of the holy men remaining unto their children.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Samuel the prophet of the Lord, the beloved of the Lord his God, established a new government, and anointed princes over his people.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>By the law of the Lord he judged the congregation, and the God of Jacob beheld, and by his fidelity he was proved a prophet.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he was known to be faithful in his words, because he saw the God of light:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And called upon the name of the Lord Almighty, in fighting against the enemies who beset him on every side, when he offered a lamb without blemish.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the Lord thundered from heaven, and with a great noise made his voice to be heard.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he crushed the princes of the Tyrians, and all the lords of the Philistines:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And before the time of the end of his life in the world, he protested before the Lord, and his anointed: money, or any thing else, even to a shoe, he had not taken of any man, and no mall did accuse him.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And after this he slept, and he made known to the king, and shewed him the end of his life, and he lifted up his voice from the earth in prophecy to blot out the wickedness of the nation. </div><ul class='tnav'>
