<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 51</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>A prayer of Jesus the son of Sirach. I will give glory to thee, O Lord, O King, and I will praise thee, O God my Saviour.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I will give glory to thy name: for thou hast been a helper and protector to me.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And hast preserved my body from destruction, from the snare of an unjust tongue, and from the lips of them that forge lies, and in the sight of them that stood by, thou hast been my helper.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And thou hast delivered me, according to the multitude of the mercy of thy name, from them that did roar, prepared to devour.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Out of the hands of them that sought my life, and from the gates of afflictions, which compassed me about:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>From the oppression of the flame which surrounded me, and in the midst of the fire I was not burnt.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>From the depth of the belly of hell, and from an unclean tongue, and from lying words, from an unjust king, and from a slanderous tongue:  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>My soul shall praise the Lord even to death.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And my life was drawing near to hell beneath.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They compassed me on every side, and there was no one that would help me. I looked for the succour of men, and there was none.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I remembered thy mercy, O Lord, and thy works, which are from the beginning of the world.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>How thou deliverest them that wait for thee, O Lord, and savest them out of the hands of the nations.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Thou hast exalted my dwelling place upon the earth and I have prayed for death to pass away.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I called upon the Lord, the father of my Lord, that he would not leave me in the day of my trouble, and in the time of the proud without help.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>I will praise thy name continually, and will praise it with thanksgiving, and my prayer was heard.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And thou hast saved me from destruction, and hast delivered me from the evil time.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Therefore I will give thanks, and praise thee, and bless the name of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>When I was yet young, before I wandered about, I sought for wisdom openly in my prayer.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>I prayed for her before the temple, and unto the very end I will seek after her, and she flourished as a grape soon ripe.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>My heart delighted in her, my foot walked in the right way, from my youth up I sought after her.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>I bowed down my ear a little, and received her.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>I found much wisdom in myself, and I profited much therein.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>To him that giveth me wisdom, will I give glory.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For I have determined to follow her: I have had a zeal for good, and shall not be confounded.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>My soul hath wrestled for her, and in doing it I have been confirmed.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>I stretched forth my hands on high, and I bewailed my ignorance of her.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>I directed my soul to her, and in knowledge I found her.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>I possessed my heart with her from the beginning: therefore I shall not be forsaken.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>My entrails were troubled in seeking her: therefore shall I possess a good possession.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>The Lord hath given me a tongue for my reward: and with it I will praise him.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Draw near to me, ye unlearned, and gather yourselves together into the house of discipline.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Why are ye slow? and what do you say of these things? your souls are exceeding thirsty.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>I have opened my mouth, and have spoken: buy her for yourselves without silver,  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And submit your neck to the yoke, and let your soul receive discipline: for she is near at hand to be found.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Behold with your eyes how I have laboured a little, and have found much rest to myself.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Receive ye discipline as a great sum of money, and possess abundance of gold by her.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Let your soul rejoice in his mercy, and you shall not be confounded in his praise.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Work your work before the time, and he will give you your reward in his time. </div><ul class='tnav'>
