Thy name is as oil poured out: therefore young maidens have loved thee.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Draw me: we will run after thee to the odour of thy ointments. The king hath brought me into his storerooms: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, remembering thy breasts more than wine: the righteous love thee.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I am black but beautiful, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Cedar, as the curtains of Solomon.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Do not consider me that I am brown, because the sun hath altered my colour: the sons of my mother have fought against me, they have made me the keeper in the vineyards: my vineyard I have not kept.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Shew me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou liest in the midday, lest I begin to wander after the flocks of thy companions.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>If thou know not thyself, O fairest among women, go forth, and follow after the steps of the flocks, and feed thy kids beside the tents of the shepherds.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>To my company of horsemen, in Pharao’s chariots, have I likened thee, O my love.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Thy cheeks are beautiful as the turtledove’s, thy neck as jewels.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>We will make thee chains of gold, inlaid with silver.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>While the king was at his repose, my spikenard sent forth the odour thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>A bundle of myrrh is my beloved to me, he shall abide between my breasts.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>A cluster of cypress my love is to me, in the vineyards of Engaddi.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Behold thou art fair, O my love, behold thou art fair, thy eyes are as those of doves.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Behold thou art fair, my beloved, and comely. Our bed is flourishing.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The beams of our houses are of cedar, our rafters of cypress trees. </div><ul class='tnav'>
