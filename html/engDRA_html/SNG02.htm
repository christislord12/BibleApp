I sat down under his shadow, whom I desired: and his fruit was sweet to my palate.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>He brought me into the cellar of wine, he set in order charity in me.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Stay me up with flowers, compass me about with apples: because I languish with love.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>His left hand is under my head, and his right hand shall embrace me.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I adjure you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and the harts of the, fields, that you stir not up, nor make the beloved to awake, till she please.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The voice of my beloved, behold he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping over the hills.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>My beloved is like a roe, or a young hart. Behold he standeth behind our wall, looking through the windows, looking through the lattices.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Behold my beloved speaketh to me: Arise, make haste, my love, my dove, my beautiful one, and come.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For winter is now past, the rain is over and gone.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The flowers have appeared in our land, the time of pruning is come: the voice of the turtle is heard in our land:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The fig tree hath put forth her green figs: the vines in flower yield their sweet smell. Arise, my love, my beautiful one, and come:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>My dove in the clefts of the rock, in the hollow places of the wall, shew me thy face, let thy voice sound in my ears: for thy voice is sweet, and thy face comely.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Catch us the little foxes that destroy the vines: for our vineyard hath flourished.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>My beloved to me, and I to him who feedeth among the lilies,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Till the day break, and the shadows retire. Return: be like, my beloved, to a roe, or to a young hart upon the mountains of Bether. </div><ul class='tnav'>
