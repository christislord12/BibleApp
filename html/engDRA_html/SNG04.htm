Thy hair is as flocks of goats, which Come up from mount Galaad.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Thy teeth as flocks of sheep, that are shorn which come up from the washing, all with twins, and there is none barren among them.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Thy lips are as a scarlet lace: and thy speech sweet. Thy cheeks are as a piece of a pomegranate, besides that which lieth hid within.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Thy neck, is as the tower of David, which is built with bulwarks: a thousand bucklers hang upon it, all the armour of valiant men.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Thy two breasts like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Till the day break, and the shadows retire, I will go to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Thou art all fair, O my love, and there is not a spot in thee.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Come from Libanus, my spouse, come from Libanus, come: thou shalt be crowned from the top of Amana, from the top of Sanir and Hermon, from the dens of the lions, from the mountains of the leopards.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Thou hast wounded my heart, my sister, my spouse, thou hast wounded my heart with one of thy eyes, and with one hair of thy neck.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>How beautiful are thy breasts, my sister, my spouse! thy breasts are more beautiful than wine, and the sweet smell of thy ointments above all aromatical spices.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Thy lips, my spouse, are as a dropping honeycomb, honey and milk are under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments, as the smell of frankincense.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>My sister, my spouse, is a garden enclosed, a garden enclosed, a fountain sealed up.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Thy plants are a paradise of pomegranates with the fruits of the orchard. Cypress with spikenard.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Spikenard and saffron, sweet cane and cinnamon, with all the trees of Libanus, myrrh and aloes with all the chief perfumes.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The fountain of gardens: the well of living waters, which run with a strong stream from Libanus.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Arise, O north wind, and come, O south wind, blow through my garden, and let the aromatical spices thereof flow. </div><ul class='tnav'>
