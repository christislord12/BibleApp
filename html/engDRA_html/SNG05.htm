I am come into my garden, O my sister, my spouse, I have gathered my myrrh, with my aromatical spices: I have eaten the honeycomb with my honey, I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends, and drink, and be inebriated, my dearly beloved.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I sleep, and my heart watcheth; the voice of my beloved knocking: Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is full of dew, and my locks of the drops of the nights.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I have put off my garment, how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet, how shall I defile them?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>My beloved put his hand through the key hole, and my bowels were moved at his touch.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>I arose up to open to my beloved: my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers were full of the choicest myrrh.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I opened the bolt of my door to my beloved: but he had turned aside, and was gone. My soul melted when he spoke: I sought him, and found him not: I called, and he did not answer me.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The keepers that go about the city found me: they struck me: and wounded me: the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my beloved, that you tell him that I languish with love.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>What manner of one is thy beloved of the beloved, O thou most beautiful among women? what manner of one is thy beloved of the beloved, that thou hast so adjured us?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>My beloved is white and ruddy, chosen out of thousands.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>His head is as the finest gold: his locks as branches of palm trees, black as a raven.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>His eyes as doves upon brooks of waters, which are washed with milk, and sit beside the plentiful streams.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>His cheeks are as beds of aromatical spices set by the perfumers. His lips are as lilies dropping choice myrrh.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>His hands are turned and as of gold, full of hyacinths. His belly as of ivory, set with sapphires.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>His legs as pillars of marble, that are set upon bases of gold. His form as of Libanus, excellent as the cedars.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>His throat most sweet, and he is all lovely: such is my beloved, and he is my friend, O ye daughters of Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou most beautiful among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside, and we will seek him with thee? </div><ul class='tnav'>
