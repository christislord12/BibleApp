Thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from Galaad.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Thy teeth as a flock of sheep, which come up from the washing, all with twins, and there is none barren among them.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Thy cheeks are as the bark of a pomegranate, beside what is hidden within thee.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and young maidens without number.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>One is my dove, my perfect one is but one, she is the only one of her mother, the chosen of her that bore her.
