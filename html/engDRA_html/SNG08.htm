Under the apple tree I raised thee up: there thy mother was corrupted, there she was defloured that bore thee.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Put me as a seal upon thy heart, as a seal upon thy arm, for love is strong as death, jealousy as hard as hell, the lamps thereof are fire and flames.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Many waters cannot quench charity, neither can the floods drown it: if a man should give all the substance of his house for love, he shall despise it as nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Our sister is little, and hath no breasts. What shall we do to our sister in the day when she is to be spoken to?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>If she be a wall: let us build upon it bulwarks of silver: if she be a door, let us join it together with boards or cedar.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I am a wall: and my breasts are as a tower since I am become in his presence as one finding peace.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The peaceable had a vineyard, in that which hath people: he let out the same to keepers, every man bringeth for the fruit thereof a thousand pieces of silver.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>My vineyard is before me. A thousand are for thee, the peaceable, and two hundred for them that keep the fruit thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the friends hearken: make me hear thy voice.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Flee away, O my beloved, and be like to the roe, and to the young hart upon the mountains of aromatical spices. </div><ul class='tnav'>
