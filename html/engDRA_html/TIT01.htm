</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of the elect of God and the acknowledging of the truth, which is according to godliness:  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Unto the hope of life everlasting, which God, who lieth not, hath promised before the times of the world:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>But hath in due times manifested his word in preaching, which is committed to me according to the commandment of God our Saviour:  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>To Titus my beloved son, according to the common faith, grace and peace from God the Father, and from Christ Jesus our Saviour.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For this cause I left thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and shouldest ordain priests in every city, as I also appointed thee:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>If any be without crime, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not accused of riot, or unruly.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For a bishop must be without crime, as the steward of God: not proud, not subject to anger, not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre:  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But given to hospitality, gentle, sober, just, holy, continent:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Embracing that faithful word which is according to doctrine, that he may be able to exhort in sound doctrine, and to convince the gainsayers.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For there are also many disobedient, vain talkers, and seducers: especially they who are of the circumcision:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Who must be reproved, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>One of them a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are always liars, evil beasts, slothful bellies.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>This testimony is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Not giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men, who turn themselves away from the truth.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>All things are clean to the clean: but to them that are defiled, and to unbelievers, nothing is clean: but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>They profess that they know God: but in their works they deny him; being abominable, and incredulous, and to every good work reprobate. </div><ul class='tnav'>
