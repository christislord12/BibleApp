These things are good and profitable unto men.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law. For they are unprofitable and vain.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>A man that is a heretic, after the first and second admonition, avoid:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Knowing that he, that is such an one, is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned by his own judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>When I shall send to thee Artemas or Tychicus, make haste to come unto me to Nicopolis. For there I have determined to winter.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Send forward Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollo, with care, that nothing be wanting to them.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And let our men also learn to excel in good works for necessary uses: that they be not unfruitful.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>All that are with me salute thee: salute them that love us in the faith. The grace of God be with you all. Amen. </div><ul class='tnav'>
