And he forthwith leaped up from his place at the table, and left his dinner, and came fasting to the body:  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And taking it up carried it privately to his house, that after the sun was down, he might bury him cautiously.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And when he had hid the body, he ate bread with mourning and fear,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Remembering the word which the Lord spoke by Amos the prophet: Your festival days shall be turned into lamentation and mourning.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So when the sun was down, he went and buried him.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Now all his neighbours blamed him, saying: Once already commandment was given for thee to be slain because of this matter, and thou didst scarce escape the sentence of death, and dost thou again bury the dead?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But Tobias fearing God more than the king, carried off the bodies of them that were slain, and hid them in his house, and at midnight buried them.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Now it happened one day, that being wearied with burying, he came to his house, and cast himself down by the wall and slept,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And as he was sleeping, hot dung out of a swallow’s nest fell upon his eyes, and he was made blind.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Now this trial the Lord therefore permitted to happen to him, that an example might be given to posterity of his patience, as also of holy Job.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For whereas he had always feared God from his infancy, and kept his commandments, he repined not against God because the evil of blindness had befallen him,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But continued immoveable in the fear of God, giving thanks to God all the days of his life.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For as the kings insulted over holy Job: so his relations and kinsmen mocked at his life, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Where is thy hope, for which thou gavest alms, and buriedst the dead?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But Tobias rebuked them, saying: Speak not so:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For we are the children of the saints, and look for that life which God will give to those that never change their faith from him.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Now Anna his wife went daily to weaving work, and she brought home what she could get for their living by the labour of her hands.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Whereby it came to pass, that she received a young kid, and brought it home:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And when her husband heard it bleating, he said: Take heed, lest perhaps it be stolen: restore ye it to its owners, for it is not lawful for us either to eat or to touch any thing that cometh by theft.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>At these words his wife being angry answered: It is evident thy hope is come to nothing, and thy alms now appear.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And with these, and other such like words she upbraided him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
