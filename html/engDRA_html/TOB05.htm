<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 5</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then Tobias answered his father, and said: I will do all things, father, which thou hast commanded me.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>But how I shall get this money, I cannot tell; he knoweth me not, and I know not him: what token shall I give him? nor did I ever know the way which leadeth thither.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then his father answered him, and said: I have a note of his hand with me, which when thou shalt shew him, he will presently pay it.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But go now, and seek thee out some faithful man, to go with thee for his hire: that thou mayst receive it, while I yet live.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then Tobias going forth, found a beautiful young man, standing girded, and as it were ready to walk.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And not knowing that he was an angel of God, he saluted him, and said: From whence art thou, good young man?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But he answered: Of the children of Israel. And Tobias said to him: Knowest thou the way that leadeth to the country of the Medes?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And he answered: I know it: and I have often walked through all the ways thereof, and I have abode with Gabelus our brother, who dwelleth at Rages a city of the Medes, which is situate in the mount of Ecbatana.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Tobias said to him: Stay for me, I beseech thee, till I tell these same things to my father.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then Tobias going in told all these things to his father. Upon which his father being in admiration, desired that he would come in unto him.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>So going in he saluted him, and said: Joy be to thee always.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Tobias said: What manner of joy shall be to me, who sit in darkness, and see not the light of heaven?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the young man said to him: Be of good courage, thy cure from God is at hand.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Tobias said to him: Canst thou conduct my son to Gabelus at Rages, a city of the Medes? and when thou shalt return, I will pay thee thy hire.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the angel said to him: I will conduct him thither, and bring him back to thee.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Tobias said to him: I pray thee, tell me, of what family, or what tribe art thou?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Raphael the angel answered: Dost thou seek the family of him thou hirest, or the hired servant himself to go with thy son?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But lest I should make thee uneasy, I am Azarias the son of the great Ananias.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Tobias answered: Thou art of a great family. But I pray thee be not angry that I desired to know thy family.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the angel said to him: I will lead thy son safe, and bring him to thee again safe.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Tobias answering, said: May you have a good journey, and God be with you in your way, and his angel accompany you.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then all things being ready, that were to be carried in their journey, Tobias bade his father and his mother farewell, and they set out both together.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And when they were departed, his mother began to weep, and to say: Thou hast taken the staff of our old age, and sent him away from us.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>I wish the money for which thou hast sent him, had never been.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For poverty was sufficient for us, that we might account it as riches, that we saw our son.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Tobias said to her: Weep not, our son will arrive thither safe, and will return safe to us, and thy eyes shall see him.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For I believe that the good angel of God doth accompany him, and doth order all things well that are done about him, so that he shall return to us with joy.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>At these words his mother ceased weeping, and held her peace. </div><ul class='tnav'>
