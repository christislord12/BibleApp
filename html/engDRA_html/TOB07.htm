And they said: We know him.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And when he was speaking many good things of him, the angel said to Raguel: Tobias concerning whom thou inquirest is this young man’s father.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And Raguel went to him, and kissed him with tears, and weeping upon his neck, said: A blessing be upon thee, my son, because thou art the son of a good and most virtuous man.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Anna his wife, and Sara their daughter wept.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And after they had spoken, Raguel commanded a sheep to be killed, and a feast to be prepared. And when he desired them to sit down to dinner,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Tobias said: I will not eat nor drink here this day, unless thou first grant me my petition, and promise to give me Sara thy daughter.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Now when Raguel heard this he was afraid, knowing what had happened to those seven husbands, that went in unto her: and he began to fear lest it might happen to him also in like manner: and as he was in suspense, and gave no answer to his petition,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The angel said to him: Be not afraid to give her to this man, for to him who feareth God is thy daughter due to be his wife: therefore another could not have her.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then Raguel said: I doubt not but God hath regarded my prayers and tears in his sight.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And I believe he hath therefore made you come to me, that this maid might be married to one of her own kindred, according to the law of Moses: and now doubt not but I will give her to thee.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And taking the right hand of his daughter, he gave it into the right hand of Tobias, saying: The God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob be with you, and may he join you together, and fulfill his blessing in you.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And taking paper they made a writing of the marriage.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And afterwards they made merry, blessing God.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Raguel called to him Anna his wife, and bade her prepare another chamber.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And she brought Sara her daughter in thither, and she wept.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And she said to her: Be of good cheer, my daughter: the Lord of heaven give thee joy for the trouble thou hast undergone. </div><ul class='tnav'>
