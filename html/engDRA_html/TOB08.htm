<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 8</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And after they had supped, they brought in the young man to her.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And Tobias remembering the angel’s word, took out of his bag part of the liver, and laid it upon burning coals.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then the angel Raphael took the devil, and bound him in the desert of upper Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then Tobias exhorted the virgin, and said to her: Sara, arise, and let us pray to God today, and tomorrow, and the next day: because for these three nights we are joined to God: and when the third night is over, we will be in our own wedlock.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For we are the children of saints, and we must not be joined together like heathens that know not God.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>So they both arose, and prayed earnestly both together that health might be given them,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And Tobias said: Lord God of our father, may the heavens and the earth, and the sea, and the fountains, and the rivers, and all thy creatures that are in them, bless thee.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Thou madest Adam of the slime of the earth, and gavest him Eve for a helper.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And now, Lord, thou knowest, that not for fleshly lust do I take my sister to wife, but only for the love of posterity, in which thy name may be blessed for ever and ever.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Sara also said: Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy on us, and let us grow old both together in health.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And it came to pass about the cockcrowing, Raguel ordered his servants to be called for, and they went with him together to dig a grave.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For he said: Lest perhaps it may have happened to him, in like manner as it did to the other seven husbands, that went in unto her.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And when they had prepared the pit, Raguel went back to his wife, and said to her:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Send one of thy maids, and let her see if he be dead, that I may bury him before it be day.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So she sent one of her maidservants, who went into the chamber, and found them safe and sound, sleeping both together.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And returning she brought the good news: and Raguel and Anna his wife blessed the Lord,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And said: We bless thee, O Lord God of Israel, because it hath not happened as we suspected.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For thou hast shewn thy mercy to us, and hast shut out from us the enemy that persecuted us.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And thou hast taken pity upon two only children. Make them, O Lord, bless thee more fully: and to offer up to thee a sacrifice of thy praise, and of their health, that all nations may know, that thou alone art God in all the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And immediately Raguel commanded his servants, to fill up the pit they had made, before it was day.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he spoke to his wife to make ready a feast, and prepare all kind of provisions that are necessary for such as go a journey.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>He caused also two fat kine, and four wethers to be killed, and a banquet to be prepared for all his neighbours, and all his friends.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Raguel adjured Tobias, to abide with him two weeks.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And of all things which Raguel possessed, he gave one half to Tobias, and made him a writing, that the half that remained should after their decease come also to Tobias. </div><ul class='tnav'>
