What can we give him sufficient for these things?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But I beseech thee, my father, to desire him, that he would vouchsafe to accept one half of all things that have been brought.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>So the father and the son, calling him, took him aside: and began to desire him that he would vouchsafe to accept of half of all things that they had brought.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then he said to them secretly: Bless ye the God of heaven, give glory to him in the sight of all that live, because he hath shewn his mercy to you.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For it is good to hide the secret of a king: but honourable to reveal and confess the works of God.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Prayer is good with fasting and alms more than to lay up treasures of gold:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For alms delivereth from death, and the same is that which purgeth away sins, and maketh to find mercy and life everlasting.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But they that commit sin and iniquity, are enemies to their own soul.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I discover then the truth unto you, and I will not hide the secret from you.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>When thou didst pray with tears, and didst bury the dead, and didst leave thy dinner, and hide the dead by day in thy house, and bury them by night, I offered thy prayer to the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And because thou wast acceptable to God, it was necessary that temptation should prove thee.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And now the Lord hath sent me to heal thee, and to deliver Sara thy son’s wife from the devil.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For I am the angel Raphael, one of the seven, who stand before the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And when they had heard these things, they were troubled, and being seized with fear they fell upon the ground on their face.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the angel said to them: Peace be to you, fear not.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For when I was with you, I was there by the will of God: bless ye him, and sing praises to him.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>I seemed indeed to eat and to drink with you: but I use an invisible meat and drink, which cannot be seen by men.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>It is time therefore that I return to him that sent me: but bless ye God, and publish all his wonderful works.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And when he had said these things, he was taken from their sight, and they could see him no more.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then they lying prostrate for three hours upon their face, blessed God: and rising up, they told all his wonderful works. </div><ul class='tnav'>
