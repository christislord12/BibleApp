Think of the Lord in goodness, and seek him in simplicity of heart.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>For he is found by them that tempt him not: and he sheweth himself to them that have faith in him.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For perverse thoughts separate from God: and his power, when it is tried, reproveth the unwise:  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For wisdom will not enter into a malicious soul, nor dwell in a body subject to sins.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For the Holy Spirit of discipline will flee from the deceitful, and will withdraw himself from thoughts that are without understanding, and he shall not abide when iniquity cometh in.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For the spirit of wisdom is benevolent, and will not acquit the evil speaker from his lips: for God is witness of his reins, and he is a true searcher of his heart, and a hearer of his tongue.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For the spirit of the Lord hath filled the whole world: and that, which containeth all things, hath knowledge of the voice.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Therefore he that speaketh unjust things cannot be hid, neither shall the chastising judgment pass him by.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For inquisition shall be made into the thoughts of the ungodly: and the hearing of his words shall come to God, to the chastising of his iniquities.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For the ear of jealousy heareth all things, and the tumult of murmuring shall not be hid.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Keep yourselves therefore from murmuring, which profiteth nothing, and refrain your tongue from detraction, for an obscure speech shall not go for nought: and the mouth that belieth, killeth the soul.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Seek not death in the error of your life, neither procure ye destruction by the works of your hands.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For God made not death, neither hath he pleasure in the destruction of the living.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For he created all things that they might be: and he made the nations of the earth for health: and there is no poison of destruction in them, nor kingdom of hell upon the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For justice is perpetual and immortal.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But the wicked with works and words have called it to them: and esteeming it a friend have fallen away, and have made a covenant with it: because they are worthy to be of the part thereof. </div><ul class='tnav'>
