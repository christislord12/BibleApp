But the things that are in heaven, who shall search out?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And who shall know thy thought, except thou give wisdom, and send thy Holy Spirit from above:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And so the ways of them that are upon earth may be corrected, and men may learn the things that please thee?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For by wisdom they were healed, whosoever have pleased thee, O Lord, from the beginning. </div><ul class='tnav'>
