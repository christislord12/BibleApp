Therefore the just took the spoils of the wicked.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And they sung to thy holy name, O Lord, and they praised with one accord thy victorious hand.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For wisdom opened the mouth of the dumb, and made the tongues of infants eloquent. </div><ul class='tnav'>
