For no man can make a god like to himself.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For being mortal himself, he formeth a dead thing with his wicked hands. For he is better than they whom he worshippeth, because he indeed hath lived, though he were mortal, but they never.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Moreover they worship also the vilest creatures: but things without sense compared to these, are worse than they.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Yea, neither by sight can any man see good of these beasts. But they have fled from the praise of God, and from his blessing. </div><ul class='tnav'>
