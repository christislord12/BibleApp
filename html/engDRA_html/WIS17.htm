Whether it were a whistling wind, or the melodious voice of birds, among the spreading branches of trees, or a fall of water running down with violence,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Or the mighty noise of stones tumbling down, or the running that could not be seen of beasts playing together, or the roaring voice of wild beasts, or a rebounding echo from the highest mountains: these things made them to swoon for fear.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For the whole world was enlightened with a clear light, and none were hindered in their labours.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But over them only was spread a heavy night, an image of that darkness which was to come upon them. But they were to themselves more grievous than the darkness. </div><ul class='tnav'>
