And he said to me: These are the horns that have scattered Juda, and Israel, and Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the Lord shewed me four smiths.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And I said: What come these to do? and he spoke, saying: These are the horns which have scattered Juda every man apart, and none of them lifted up his head: and these are come to fray them, to cast down the horns of the nations, that have lifted up the horn upon the land of Juda to scatter it. </div><ul class='tnav'>
