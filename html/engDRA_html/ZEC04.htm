And I said: I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold, and its lamp upon the top of it: and the seven lights thereof upon it: and seven funnels for the lights that were upon the top thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And two olive trees over it: one upon the right side of the lamp, and the other upon the left side thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And I answered, and said to the angel that spoke in me, saying: What are these things, my lord?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the angel that spoke in me answered, and said to me: Knowest thou not what these things are? And I said: No, my lord.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And he answered, and spoke to me, saying: This is the word of the Lord to Zorobabel, saying: Not with an army, nor by might, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Who art thou, O great mountain, before Zorobabel? thou shalt become a plain: and he shall bring out the chief stone, and shall give equal grace to the grace thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The hands of Zorobabel have laid the foundations of this house, and his hands shall finish it: and you shall know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me to you.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For who hath despised little days? and they shall rejoice, and shall see the tin plummet in the hand of Zorobabel. These are the seven eyes of the Lord, that run to and fro through the whole earth.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And I answered, and said to him: What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick, and upon the left side thereof?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And I answered again, and said to him: What are the two olive branches, that are by the two golden beaks, in which are the funnels of gold?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And he spoke to me, saying: Knowest thou not what these are? And I said: No, my lord.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he said: These are two sons of oil who stand before the Lord of the whole earth. </div><ul class='tnav'>
