And he said: Go, walk throughout the earth: and they walked throughout the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And he called me, and spoke to me, saying: Behold they that go forth into the land of the north, have quieted my spirit in the land of the north.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Take of them of the captivity, of Holdai, and of Tobias, and of Idaias; thou shalt come in that day, and shalt go into the house of Josias, the son of Sophonias, who came out of Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And thou shalt take gold and silver: and shalt make crowns, and thou shalt set them on the head of Jesus the son of Josedec, the high priest.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And thou shalt speak to him, saying: Thus saith the Lord of hosts, saying: BEHOLD A MAN, THE ORIENT IS HIS NAME: and under him shall he spring up, and shall build a temple to the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Yea, he shall build a temple to the Lord: and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit, and rule upon his throne: and he shall be a priest upon his throne, and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the crowns shall be to Helem, and Tobias, and Idaias, and to Hem, the son of Sophonias, a memorial in the temple of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And they that are far off, shall come and shall build in the temple of the Lord: and you shall know that the Lord of hosts sent me to you. But this shall come to pass, if hearing you will hear the voice of the Lord your God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
