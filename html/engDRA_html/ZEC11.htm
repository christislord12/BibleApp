And I took unto me two rods, one I called Beauty, and the other I called a Cord, and I fed the flock.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And I cut off three shepherds in one month, and my soul was straitened in their regard: for their soul also varied in my regard.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And I said: I will not feed you: that which dieth, let it die: and that which is cut off, let it be cut off: and let the rest devour every one the flesh of his neighbour.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And I took my rod that was called Beauty, and I cut it asunder to make void my covenant, which I had made with all people.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And it was made void in that day: and so the poor of the flock that keep for me, understood that it is the word of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And I said to them: If it be good in your eyes, bring hither my wages: and if not, be quiet. And they weighed for my wages thirty pieces of silver.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the Lord said to me: Cast it to the statuary, a handsome price, that I was prized at by them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and I cast them into the house of the Lord to the statuary.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And I cut off my second rod that was called a Cord, that I might break the brotherhood between Juda and Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the Lord said to me: Take to thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For behold I will raise up a shepherd in the land, who shall not visit what is forsaken, nor seek what is scattered, nor heal what is broken, nor nourish that which standeth, and he shall eat the flesh of the fat ones, and break their hoofs.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>O shepherd, and idol, that forsaketh the flock: the sword upon his arm and upon his right eye: his arm shall quite wither away, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened. </div><ul class='tnav'>
