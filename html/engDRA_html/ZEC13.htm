And his father, and his mother, his parents, shall thrust him through, when he shall prophesy.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be confounded, every one by his own vision, when he shall prophesy, neither shall they be clad with a garment of sackcloth, to deceive:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But he shall say: I am no prophet, I am a husbandman: for Adam is my example from my youth.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And they shall say to him: What are these wounds in the midst of thy hands? And he shall say: With these I was wounded in the house of them that loved me.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that cleaveth to me, saith the Lord of hosts: strike the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn my hand to the little ones.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And there shall be in all the earth, saith the Lord, two parts in it shall be scattered, and shall perish: but the third part shall be left therein.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined: and I will try them as gold is tried. They shall call on my name, and I will hear them. I will say: Thou art my people: and they shall say: The Lord is my God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
