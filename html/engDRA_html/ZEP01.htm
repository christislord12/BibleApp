All the people of Chanaan is hush, all are cut off that were wrapped up in silver.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with lamps, and will visit upon the men that are settled on their lees: that say in their hearts: The Lord will not do good, nor will he do evil.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And their strength shall become a booty, and their houses as a desert: and they shall build houses, and shall not dwell in them: and they shall plant vineyards, and shall not drink the wine of them.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The great day of the Lord is near, it is near and exceeding swift: the voice of the day of the Lord is bitter, the mighty man shall there meet with tribulation.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>That day is a day of wrath, a day of tribulation and distress, a day of calamity and misery, a day of darkness and obscurity, a day of clouds and whirlwinds,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and against the high bulwarks.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And I will distress men, and they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the Lord: and their blood shall be poured out as earth, and their bodies as dung.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Neither shall their silver and their gold be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the Lord: all the land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy, for he shall make even a speedy destruction of all them that dwell in the land. </div><ul class='tnav'>
